## Handling new issues

After reading a new issue, please label it either as <span class="label-bug">bug</span> or as
<span class="label-feature">feature</span>.

If it is a bug, please also assign the ticket to the milestone of the version in which the bug needs to be fixed (e.g.
`4.4`). Do not assign feature requests to a milestone. 

New issues do not get an assignee by default.

## Handling new PRs

After reading a new PR, please label it either as <span class="label-bug">bug</span> or as
<span class="label-feature">feature</span>.

If the PR is targeted against an active version branch (e.g. `4.4`), please assign it to the corresponding milestone.
Do not assign PRs targeted against the `master` branch to a milestone.

Please assign new PRs to their creator.

## Reviewing bug reports

If you cannot reproduce the bug, please add the <span class="label-status">unconfirmed</span> label to the ticket. If
it is unclear how to fix the bug, please add the <span class="label-discuss">up for discussion</span> label.

If you want to work on the bug yourself, self-assign the ticket.

If nobody assigns themselves a ticket, it will get the <span class="label-help">help wanted</span> label to indicate
that we are looking for volunteers to complete it.

If the bug cannot be fixed without breaking backwards compatibility, please add the
<span class="label-status">incompatible</span> label. 
 
## Reviewing feature requests

If it is unclear how to implement the feature, please add the <span class="label-discuss">up for discussion</span>
label to the ticket. If the feature cannot be implemented without breaking backwards compatibility, please add the
<span class="label-status">incompatible</span> label. 

## Stale tickets

Tickets are considered stale after 60 days if they

* have no label or
* are labeled as <span class="label-bug">bug</span> and are not labeled as
  <span class="label-discuss">up for discussion</span>, <span class="label-help">help wanted</span> or
  <span class="label-status">incompatible</span>.
