description: "How to control and access the Contao Manager through its REST API."
---


The Contao Manager is distributed as a Phar application. Apart from the graphical user interface,
the application also provides a REST API to interact with the webserver and Contao application.

The Contao Manager API is available under `/api` wherever you installed the Phar. 
If your website runs on `https://example.com`, and the Contao Manager has been uploaded as 
`contao-manager.phar.php` to the root folder, the API will be available at 
`https://example.com/contao-manager.phar.php/api/`.

To learn more about the available REST features, please consult our [OpenAPI documentation][API].


## Authentication

Authentication is necessary to interact with any API endpoint of the Contao Manager. 
There are two ways to authenticate, depending on your use case.


### Option 1: Temporary authentication using an HTTP-only cookie
    
This is the preferred approach if your UI is accessing the Contao Manager through the
browser, similar to what the Contao Manager does itself. Your UI will not need
to store any authentication details, as the browser securely takes care of that.
However, these access details also automatically expire, so they are only useful for
interactions where the user needs to log in to the Contao Manager prior to any API access.

Consult the [OpenAPI Docs][API] on how to use the `/api/session` endpoint.


### Option 2: Persistent authentication through API tokens

For long term authentication or without involving the browser, the Contao Manager
supports authentication tokens. Tokens are always bound to a specific user account
and work similar to any other OAuth authentication.

{{% notice info %}}
The Contao Manager implements standard [OAuth Implicit Grant](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-4.2) as far as possible. We are aware that Implicit Grant is 
not recommended for security reasons, but other OAuth protocols require you to register an application ID prior to 
accessing the OAuth endpoint. As an example: on Facebook, you have to register as a developer and register your 
application to get a private key, before you can access the API and get a token. Because the Contao Manager is 
distributed to every user, we cannot have a (predefined) list of applications that would be allowed to use OAuth.

#### Creating the API token

Creating a token is only possible after authenticating to the Contao Manager. Technically,
this means a user has to authentication through the `/api/session` endpoint in a browser,
to then be able to create an access token. Because users should not enter their username
and password on your website (where you could grab the password), the Contao Manager provides
a built-in workflow to get an API token.

Given the URL examples above, all you have to do is point the browser to the following location:

```
https://example.com/contao-manager.phar.php/#oauth?response_type=token&scope=admin&client_id=XXX&redirect_uri=https://your-website.com/your-script.php&state=XXX
``` 

The supported parameters are:

- `response_type` (REQUIRED) must be set to `token` for [OAuth Implicit Grant][OAuth]

- `scope` (REQUIRED) is the requested access. Currently only `admin` is a supported value, as the Contao Manager does not yet
  support permissions.
  
- `client_id` (REQUIRED) is a representative name for your application. The `client_id` is also stored alongside the token, 
  each `client_id` will get a different access token. Requesting with an existing `client_id`, a new token will be 
  issued and the existing token is overwritten.
 
- `redirect_uri` (REQUIRED) is where the user is sent back to after allowing or denying access to your application.

- `state` (OPTIONAL) is used to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks (see [OAuth CSRF][CSRF])
   
 
The user will be presented with the following dialog with two options:

![Contao Manager OAuth Screen]({{% asset "images/dev/internals/oauth.png" %}}?width=449&classes=shadow)

1. When clicking on **Allow Access**, the Contao Manager will generate a token, append it to the
  `redirect_uri` according to [OAuth Implicit Grant][Response] and redirect the user to that URL. 
   You can then read the token from the URL fragment using JavaScript and store it on your application.
   
2. If the user clicks on **Deny Access**, they will be redirected to the `redirect_uri` with `error=access_denied`.

3. In any other error case, as long as the `redirect_uri` is valid, the user will be redirected back to the resource 
   owner (see [OAuth Error Response][Error]). 


#### Authenticating with an API token

Now that you successfully acquired a token, you can use it to perform API requests on the Contao Manager.
For each request, the token must be sent in an HTTP header.

1. Using tokens for authentication has been standardized as [RFC 6750][rfc6750] and is commonly known as _Bearer Authentication_,
   which is fully supported by the Contao Manager. Add the `Authentication: Bearer <your-token>` to your request header to authentication API requests.

2. Unfortunately, there are known issues with some versions of the Apache webservers, which will remove `Authentication: Bearer` headers
   from your request, so they will never reach the Contao Manager. To circumvent this issue, the Contao Manager supports an alternative
   `Contao-Manager-Auth: <your-token>` header for authentication.
   
If you are in control of the webserver where Contao Manager is running, and you can make sure you don't run into the mentioned issue, using
the standardized `Authentication` header is the preferred way. If you need to support any Contao Manager on any unknown host, the best
approach is to use the `Contao-Manager-Auth` header which will be left untouched by Apache.


## One-Time Passwordless Authentication

Contao Manager 1.7+ supports _one-time passwordless login URLs_. Using a one-time token, users can be logged in 
automatically to the Contao Manager front end in the browser. A use case would be a tool that has API access to the 
Contao Manager, which can then generate a URL that automatically logs a user in to the Contao Manager front end without 
requiring username and password.

One-time tokens are valid for 30 seconds and can be used only once, as their name suggests. They can be created using 
the Contao Manager API by creating a new token with a `grant_type=one-time` parameters. The response will include
a `url` to the Contao Manager for passwordless login. See the [OpenAPI documentation][grant-type] for details.
