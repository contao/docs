Another common task is to change existing translations and labels for the front 
or back end. Any translation changes or additional translations are done in the
`contao/languages/<language>/` folder. Within each language's folder a file needs
to be created according to the translation's _domain_.

Assume you want to change the translation of _"Read more â€¦"_ for the English language
(used for the detail link of a news or calendar entry for example) to just _"more"_. 
The translation key for this particular label is `MSC.more` in the `default` translation 
domain. Thus you need to create a file with the following content:

```php
// contao/languages/en/default.php
$GLOBALS['TL_LANG']['MSC']['more'] = 'more';
```

Alternatively you can also create an XLIFF file (`.xlf`) instead of using the PHP
array notation. Finding the right translation key and domain can only be done by 
searching through the source of the translations. 

{{< version-tag "5.3" >}} Since Contao **5.3** you can also use Symfony translations by prefixing the Contao translation
domain with `contao_`:

```yaml
# translations/contao_default.en.yaml
MSC:
    more: more
```
