There are two main cases when developing within Contao: either you want to customize
your project-specific web application, or you want to create a re-usable extension -
either for your own purposes or for others. In either case, the principles are the
same. However, when creating an extension for Contao, there are some differences
in structure and procedure. This articles covers the former case and also assumes 
the usage of the Contao Managed Edition. [Another article][1] explains how to create 
a reusable extension.

The purpose of this article is to show the directory structure of Contao and explain
what goes where - and what to do initially for certain customization tasks.


## Structure

After a fresh install of Contao, your project will have a certain initial file &
directory structure (which is similar to the structure of a pure Symfony project
using the `symfony/skeleton` for example).

| File/Directory  | Explanation                                                                 |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `assets/`       | JavaScript and CSS assets of the Contao framework and third parties.        |
| `config/`       | Application configuration files.                                            |
| `files/`        | Public or protected files manged by Contao's file manager.                  |
| `system/`       | Legacy folder for Contao 3 compatibility.                                   |
| `templates/`    | Customized Contao & Twig templates.                                         |
| `var/`          | Transient files like the application cache and log files.                   |
| `vendor/`       | Composer's vendor folder containing all dependencies (including Contao).    |
| `web/`          | Public entry points; contains symlinks to other public ressources.          |
| `composer.json` | `composer.json` of your project defining your dependencies and autoloading. |

When customizing your web application, the follwing files and folders will usually
be of interest. Some of those will need to be created manually:

| File/Directory  | Explanation                                                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `config/`       | Application configuration.                                                     |
| `contao/`       | Contao configuration and translations.                                         |
| `src/`          | Your own PHP code: controllers, event listeners for hooks and other services.  |
| `templates/`    | Templates for your own modules and elements, or customized existing templates. |
| `composer.json` | Add dependencies, customize autoloading if required.                           |

{{% notice note %}}
Contao **4.4** still uses the Symfony 3 directory structure. The `config/` folder 
will be in `app/config/` and the `contao/` folder will be in `app/Resources/contao/`
instead.

### Application Configuration

The [configuration of a Symfony application][11] is done within the `config/` directory
through various YAML files. The Contao Managed Edition automatically loads the following
configurations, if present:

| File                     | Explanation                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `.env`                   | Parameters like database and SMTP server credentials.<sup>1</sup>                             |
| `.env.local`             | Loaded if both `.env` and `.env.local` are found. Overrides parameters for local development. |
| `.env.dist`              | Loaded if `.env` is not found. Contains default parameters for the application.               |
| `config/config.yml`      | Configuration of any bundle/package/extension.                                                |
| `config/config_dev.yml`  | Configuration for the `dev` environment.                                                      |
| `config/config_prod.yml` | Configuration for the `prod` environment.                                                     |
| `config/parameters.yml`  | Parameters like database and SMTP server credentials.<sup>1</sup>                             |
| `config/routing.yml`     | Definition of application specific routes.                                                    |

{{% notice note %}}
<sup>1</sup> Contao still supports the legacy way of defining parameters in a Symfony
application through the `parameters.yml`. However it is best-practice to use the
`.env` files instead.
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice tip %}}
While Contao does not load a `config/services.yml` automatically, you can still
import it in your `config/config.yml` via

```yml
imports:
  - { resource: services.yml }
```
{{% /notice %}}


### Contao Configuration & Translations

Contao has its own configuration files in the form of PHP arrays, as well as translation
files in the form of either PHP arrays or in an XLIFF format.

| File/Directory             | Explanation                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `contao/config/config.php` | Registering modules, content elements, models, hooks, crons, etc. |
| `contao/dca/`              | [Data Container Array][2] customizations and definitions.         |
| `contao/languages/`        | Contao translations - contains sub directories for each language. |
| `contao/languages/de/`     | German translations.                                              |
| `contao/languages/en/`     | English translations (also serves as the fallback).               |
| `contao/languages/â€¦/`      | etc.                                                              |

Have a look at the [DCA documentation][2] on how to handle DCA files and the [translation documentation][3]
on how to handle translation files. The content of the `config.php` depends on the
use-case and its documentation is covered in the applicable topics of the [framework documentation][4].


## Autoloading, Services and Actions

Any custom class that is needed for the web application - like a [Model][5], a [Content Element][6]
or a class for a [Hook][7] for example - needs to be loaded. Typically
the code for customizing the web application for Contao will be put in the `\App`
namespace. The default `composer.json` of the recent Contao Managed Edition versions
already contains the appropriate autoloading directive:

```json
{
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "App\\": "src/"
        }
    }
}
```

Any of these classes can also be registered as Symfony services, which is necessary
if you want to use dependency injection and service tagging. Registering Contao 
hooks, content elements, front end modules, cron jobs and Data Container callbacks
is done via service tags.

For the application development it is recommended to use [autowiring][8] and [auto-configuration][9], 
which makes it easy to create new services and tag them automatically (through annotations
or class interfaces) - and thus enables quick development of Contao content elements, 
hooks, callbacks etc.

```yaml
# config/services.yml
services:
    _defaults:
        autowire: true
        autoconfigure: true
        public: false

    App\:
        resource: ../src
        exclude: ../src/{Entity,Migrations,Resources,Tests}
    
    App\Action\:
        resource: ../src/Action
        public: true
```

```yaml
# config/routing.yml
app.action:
    resource: ../src/Action
    type: annotation
```

```yaml
# config/config.yml
imports:
    - { resource: services.yml }
```

{{% notice note %}}
The above `services.yml` and `routing.yml` also contain directives for the new ADR 
(Action Domain Responder) pattern for custom routes as recommended within Symfony.
{{% /notice %}}

Once this is configured, hooks, callbacks, content elements and front end modules
for example can be created without having to configure them in separate files by 
using annotations for service tagging.

All this is not needed, if you only need to change or extend the Data
Container Array definition of a table, or want to change a translation for
example.

Next: [create your first DCA adjustment][12].
