title: "Commands"

Contao uses the Console component of Symfony and provides a few commands.
To execute these commands locate the `console` executable in your project
and append the subsequently documented commands.

```sh
$> php bin/console <command-name>
```


## `contao:automator`

This command is an interface to the `Automator` class of Contao. It mainly consists
of common tasks around the maintenance of a Contao installation.

```sh
$> php bin/console contao:automator [<task>]
```

The command itself can be executed without providing a task. It will then
ask for it. The following tasks are available.

| Task                    | Description                                                                                                                                           |
