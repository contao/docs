description: Contao's console commands.
---


Contao uses the Console component of Symfony and provides a few commands.
To execute these commands locate the `console` executable in your project
and append the subsequently documented commands.

```sh
$> php bin/console <command-name>
```

{{% notice note %}}
In the Contao Managed Edition, the path to the console script is `vendor/bin/contao-console`
instead.
{{% /notice %}}

By appending the `--help` argument to any command, a usage guide is printed to the shell.

```sh
$> php bin/console contao:user:password --help

Description:
  Changes the password of a Contao back end user.

Usage:
  contao:user:password [options] [--] <username>

Arguments:
  username                 The username of the back end user

Options:
  -p, --password=PASSWORD  The new password
  […]

```


## `contao:automator`

This command is an interface to the `Automator` class of Contao. It mainly consists
of common tasks around the maintenance of a Contao installation.

```sh
$> php bin/console contao:automator [<task>]
```

The command itself can be executed without providing a task. It will then
ask for it. The following tasks are available.

| Task                    | Description                                                                                                                                           |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `purgeSearchTables`     | Clears the search index by deleting the tables `tl_search` and `tl_search_index`.                                                                     |
| `purgeUndoTable`        | Removes the temporarily stored undo entries, which allows for restoring deleted entries.                                                              |
| `purgeVersionTable`     | Purges the version table `tl_version` which holds different versions for rows in tables that have the versioning feature enabled.                     |
| `purgeSystemLog`        | Deletes entries in the system log.                                                                                                                    |
| `purgeImageCache`       | Purges the image cache by deleting all processed and resized images in the configurable `image.target_dir`.                                           |
| `purgeScriptCache`      | Removes processed and/or minified JavaScript files and Stylesheets.                                                                                   |
| `purgePageCache`        | Clears the page cache by removing cached html responses.                                                                                              |

## `contao:crawl`

{{< version "4.9" >}}

As of Contao 4.9, Contao is equipped with an HTTP crawler. Internally, it is built
on top of [Escargot](https://github.com/terminal42/escargot).
The crawler essentially just crawls all the URLs generated by Contao as any other
crawler. It follows links that are part of the `sitemap.xml`, respects `robots.txt` information,
the `rel` attribute on links and much more.
While doing this, any number of so-called "subscribers" can subscribe to the results of the HTTP
requests and basically process them further in any way they want. As of today, Contao knows
two subscribers:

* `search-index` - updates the built-in search index (only available if searching was even enabled)
* `broken-link-checker` - checks all the pages for broken links

Any extension might provide additional subscribers so this list is not necessarily conclusive.
Use it as follows:

```sh
$> php bin/console contao:crawl [options] [<job>]
```

There is only one argument to this command which is `job`. It is optional and represents a job ID.
Crawling can be a very long-running task so in case you want to stop and pick up where you left later,
you need to remember the job ID you were assigned when you first ran the command and you can then
resume with that job ID later on. However, as there is usually no such thing as memory or runtime limits
on CLI, this will likely not be used very often.

The options are far more important so let's get to them right away:


| Option               | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `--subscribers (-s)` | By default, all subscribers are enabled but you can pass a comma-separated list of subscribers you want to enable. E.g. if you only want to check for broken links, only pass `broken-link-checker` here. |
| `--concurrency (-c)` | This option allows to configure the number of concurrent requests. The higher, the faster the process will complete but webservers only handle a certain amount of concurrent requests so choose the value wisely. |
| `--delay`            | To make sure you are not hammering a webserver, you can also configure a delay. This is in microseconds and will just cause the crawler to wait `n` microseconds between requests. |
| `--max-requests`     | By default, there is no limit configured but if you want to only execute a certain number of requests in total, you can do that with this option. If you want to pick up the job later, see the `job` argument. |
| `--max-depth`        | This is the tree depth, the crawler is going to search. The root page is basically level 1 and all the links found there will be level 2. All the links found on level 2 will be level 3 and so on. By default, there is no max-depth configured. The higher the number, the deeper the crawler will search but it will also take longer. |
| `--enable-debug-csv` | By default the subscriber results are written to the standard output. You can ask the command to write everything to a CSV file by passing this option. |
| `--debug-csv-path`   | This option allows you to override the default CSV file path, if you used `--enable-debug-csv`. |

## `contao:migrate`

{{< version "4.9" >}}

With this command you can perform migrations after a new installation, an update of Contao or an extension. 
The migrations that get executed are update scripts of Contao, registered migrations of 
extensions, legacy `runonce.php` files and the database update.

```sh
$> php bin/console contao:migrate [options]
```

| Option             | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `--with-deletes`   | Executes all database migrations including `DROP` queries.|
| `--schema-only`    | Executes database schema migration only. Update scripts, registered migrations and `runonce.php` files get skipped.|
| `--no-interaction` | With this option enabled all confirmation questions are automatically answered with “yes”. This is useful if you want to execute the migrations in an automated system.|

## `contao:resize-images`

{{< version "4.8" >}}

With this command you can process all deferred images that were not yet resized.

```sh
$> php bin/console contao:resize-images [options]
```

| Option             | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `--concurrent`     | Run multiple processes concurrently with a value larger than 1 or pause between resizes to limit CPU utilization with values lower than 1.0. On a shared hosting environment it might make sense to use a value lower than `0.5` to limit the CPU consumption to 50%.|
| `--time-limit`     | Time limit in seconds after which the command should stop execution.|
| `--image=IMAGE`    | Pass an image path like `1/foobar-f6eac395d.jpg` (without the `assets/images` prefix) to resize one specific image only.|
| `--no-sub-process` | Disables the use of a sub process for each image resize. Use with caution, this could result in an extremely high memory consumption.|


## Other commands

* `contao:filesync`: Synchronises the file system to the database.
* `contao:install`: Creates various empty directories which Contao relies on.
* `contao:symlinks`: Creates various symlinks to the web directory, for example publicly reachable file directories, the assets directory or `system/themes`.
* `contao:user:password`: Allows for changing a users password on the shell.
