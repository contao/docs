description: Contao's console commands.
---


Contao uses the Console component of Symfony and provides a few commands.
To execute these commands locate the `console` executable in your project
and append the subsequently documented commands.

```sh
$> php bin/console <command-name>
```

{{% notice note %}}
In the Contao Managed Edition, the path to the console script is `vendor/bin/contao-console`
instead.
{{% /notice %}}

By appending the `--help` argument to any command, a usage guide is printed to the shell.

```sh
$> php bin/console contao:user:password --help

Description:
  Changes the password of a Contao back end user.

Usage:
  contao:user:password [options] [--] <username>

Arguments:
  username                 The username of the back end user

Options:
  -p, --password=PASSWORD  The new password
  [â€¦]

```


## `contao:automator`

This command is an interface to the `Automator` class of Contao. It mainly consists
of common tasks around the maintenance of a Contao installation.

```sh
$> php bin/console contao:automator [<task>]
```

The command itself can be executed without providing a task. It will then
ask for it. The following tasks are available.

| Task                    | Description                                                                                                                                           |
