Contao overrides [Twig's default `escape` filter](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/filters/escape.html) in order to
support `ChunkedText` from [insert tags]({{% ref insert-tags %}}) and to employ its own escaper strategies. 

## Double Encoding Prevention

As mention in other sections, Contao uses input encoding by default which would then lead to double encoded output when
rendering content in Twig. Contao overrides this behavior for templates within the `@Contao` and `@Contao_*` namespaces.

```twig
{# Outputs &gt; i.e. without double encoding #}
{{ '&gt;'|e }}
```

{{< version "5.3.19" >}}

However, you can opt into double encoding by passing `double_encode = true` to the escape filter, which is necessary if
you have HTML code nested in another language.

```twig
{# Outputs &amp;gt; i.e. with double encoding #}
{{ '&gt;'|e('html', doubl_encode = true) }}
```

You can find more information in the double encoding section of the
[Twig architecture]({{% ref "architecture#double-encoding-prevention" %}}) article.

## `ChunkedText` Support

Some insert tags might return a `ChunkedText` instance. The `ChunkedText` container was created to keep the surrounding
text containing the insert tags separate from the replacements made by the insert tag parser. For example
`{{ text|insert_tag_raw|escape('html') }}` only escapes the parts that do not come from the replaced insert tags.
