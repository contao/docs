Contao heavily relies on HTTP caching and tries it's very best to comply to the HTTP standards to provide the best
performance possible.

It's thus essential that you understand the basics of HTTP caching. Before we get into details of Contao too much, let's
talk HTTP basics first.


## Private and Shared Caches

A `Private Cache` is a cache that is intended for a single user only and must not be stored by a shared cache.
A `Shared Cache` is a cache that can be shared amongst many users. It's also known as `Public Cache` or `Reverse Proxy Cache`.

Whether your response can only be cached by a single user only or also by a `Shared Cache` that sits between Contao
and the client can be controlled very easily using the `Cache-Control` header:

```php
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

/** @var Response $response */
$response->headers->set('Cache-Control', 'private'); // private
$response->headers->set('Cache-Control', 'public'); // public
```


## Caching methods

The three caching methods involve:

1. Cache Expiration
2. Cache Validation
3. Cache Invalidation

All of them cover a different use case and `Cache Invalidation` only works for `Shared Caches`.
Let's dive a bit more into them.


### Cache Expiration

Using `Cache Expiration` you can control how long a cache entry will be kept in the cache until it expires.
Essentially you have two different headers here: `Expires` and `Cache-Control`.
We've already seen `Cache-Control` before where we wanted to control whether a cache entry is targeted at a single
user only or if it can be cached by a `Shared Cache`. But `Cache-Control` an combine multiple directives which is
why Symfony provides an abstraction to it so you don't have to write the `Cache-Control` header yourself:

```php
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

/** @var Response $response */
$response->headers->addCacheControlDirective('private'); // private
$response->headers->addCacheControlDirective('max-age', 60); // can be stored for 60 seconds
```

```php
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;

/** @var Response $response */
$response->headers->addCacheControlDirective('public'); // public
$response->headers->addCacheControlDirective('s-maxage', 60); // can be stored for 60 seconds on the shared cache
$response->headers->addCacheControlDirective('max-age', 600); // can be stored for 600 seconds in the private cache
```

You can read more on the different headers for example on [MDN web docs][2] which is an excellent resource.


### Cache Validation

Sometimes it's not possible to define how long a cache entry can be cached. A request then has to be made to the server
but yet still, if the content still is the same, it does not need to be sent over the wire again.
That's when `Cache Validation` comes into place. Whether or not a cache entry is still valid can be determined by two
different methods:

* Date based
* Key based

You can either send a `Last-Modified` header that contains a date or an `ETag` header that associates your response
with a certain unique key. When the client then requests the server again, it can send along the `If-Not-Modified-Since`
or `If-None-Match` headers to ask the server to only redeliver the content if it wasn't modified since the last
modified date or if it does not match the last provided `ETag`. If the response is unmodified, the server can reply
with a `304 Not Modified` HTTP response without any content, otherwise the regular response with an updated `Last-Modified`
or `ETag` header is sent.

Read more on `Cache Validation` on [MDN web docs][2] and in the [Symfony documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/http_cache/validation.html).


### Cache Invalidation

The best way to cache would be "forever until I tell you that the cache entry is now invalid". `Cache Invalidation` does
exactly that except for the fact that in the world of HTTP "forever" means "1 year". It's impossible to have cache entries
that last longer than a year.
Now to be able to tell a cache that it shall invalidate a previously sent response, you need access to it. In other words
this method only applies to `Shared Caches` where we have access to and know how certain cache entries can be invalidated.

Sounds pretty advanced, why do we need that?

Every Contao Managed Edition ships with the Symfony Reverse Proxy (`HttpCache`). That means, every Contao setup provides
a reverse proxy aka `Shared Cache` that is able to cache our generated responses. It's thus very important you get your
caching headers right, otherwise you'll suddenly end up having responses of e.g. your content elements being cached even
if they were not meant to.

The whole caching framework around Contao is built on top of the awesome [FOSHttpCacheBundle][3] which allows different
reverse proxies to be configured. As outlined before, Contao comes pre-configured using Symfony's `HttpCache` as proxy but
uses the alternative storage back end [toflar/psr6-symfony-http-cache-store][1] which is a bit more advanced and in
contrast to the one provided by Symfony itself also supports cache invalidation by tags.

So when you generate a response, you can tag it by any number of tags and later on, purge them.
Let's say you had a news entry with ID 42 and you want to make sure that whenever a back end user modifies e.g. the news
title, all pages that may list this news entry somewhere must be invalidated.
You'll certainly have a detail page of that news but potentially there are also pages that may show the title of this news
such as a news archive module or maybe a sidebar that lists the latest news entries.
You'll end up having multiple pages that need to be invalidated:

* https://www.example.com/news/my-super-news-item.html (detail page)
* https://www.example.com/news.html (news list)
* https://www.example.com (latest news in the sidebar)
* https://www.example.com/archive/news.html (news archive)

Now what you can do is whenever your news ID 42 is used somewhere, you'll just tag that response with a tag `news-42`
which will associate all of these four URLs with the tag `news-42`.
You can then ask the reverse proxy to purge all responses associated with the tag `news-42` when the back end user
edits that news entry.

Contao provides a nice framework for that so you don't have to re-invent the wheel over and over again.
Make sure you inject the service `fos_http_cache.http.symfony_response_tagger` and add your desired tags to this
service. It will collect all the tags during the current request and add them to the response using a `kernel.response`
event listener (if you've never heard of those, please head over to [the Symfony docs][4]).

This might look something like this:

```php
// src/Controller/MySuperController.php
namespace App\Controller;

use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;
use FOS\HttpCache\ResponseTagger;

class MySuperController
{
    /**
     * @var ResponseTagger
     */
    private $responseTagger;
    
    public function __construct(ResponseTagger $responseTagger)
    {
        $this->responseTagger = $responseTagger;
    }
    
    public function __invoke(): Response
    {
        $this->responseTagger->addTags(['news-42']);
        
        return new Response();
    }
}
```

If you are working with Contao fragments such as content elements, front end modules etc. note that you may want to
extend the `Contao\CoreBundle\Controller\AbstractFragmentController` and use its `tagResponse()` method for
convenience.

To invalidate a given set of tags, inject the service `fos_http_cache.cache_manager` which might look like so:

```php
// src/EventListener/UserChangedSomethingListener.php
namespace App\EventListener;

use FOS\HttpCacheBundle\CacheManager;

class UserChangedSomethingListener
{
    /**
     * @var CacheManager
     */
    private $cacheManager;
    
    public function __construct(CacheManager $cacheManager)
    {
        $this->cacheManager = $cacheManager;
    }
    
    public function onUserChangedSomething()
    {
        $this->cacheManager->invalidateTags(['news-42']);
    }
}
```

Invalidation requests will be collected during the same request too and only be executed during the `kernel.terminate`
event.


#### Cache tag invalidation within the Contao back end

When working with DCAs in the Contao back end you don't have to register callbacks at various places to make sure certain
tags are being invalidated. This is because Contao invalidates a certain set of tags whenever a back end entry is created,
updated or deleted. The tags are as follows:

* `contao.db.<table-name>`
* `contao.db.<table-name>.<id>`
* `contao.db.<parent-table-name>` (only if there is a parent table defined)
* `contao.db.<parent-table-name>.<pid>` (only if there is a parent record)

So let's say you had a DCA table named `tl_news`. When you edit ID `42`, Contao would automatically send an invalidation
request to the reverse proxy to invalidate all responses associated with the tags `contao.db.tl_news` and `contao.db.tl_news.42`.
If you follow this convention and tag your responses accordingly in the front end, you don't have to do any work in the
back end at all!

Moreover, you don't have to register to all the different callbacks such as `onsubmit_callback` or `ondelete_callback`.
You can register to the [`oninvalidate_cache_tags` callback][5] and add your own tags.
