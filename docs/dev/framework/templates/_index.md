This section covers Twig templates in Contao **4.13** and up. The documentation for legacy PHP templates (`.html5`
extension) can be found in [this article](/framework/templates/legacy/).
{{% /notice %}}


## History and development
Contao's template system builds on the [Twig][Twig Docs] template engine. Historically, PHP templates were used and are
now transitioned away from â€” this is why you can still find a lot of their remains in the current codebase. Native Twig
support made its way into the core in Contao 4.12 and allowed users to substitute existing templates with Twig
templates. Beginning with Contao 5, the majority of content elements were rewritten and are now Twig-only. Extrapolating
from here, we ultimately plan to drop support for the PHP templating system in Contao 6.

{{% notice info %}}
It's hard to get things right in the first try and replacing the old template system with Twig is a big undertaking.
That's why some classes in the `Contao\Twig` namespace are still marked with `@experimental`. First up, this neither
means, that we will remove the functionality or randomly change things up, nor that you should not use them (in
contrary!). It allows us to tweak things and make changes to the classes' API in a minor/bugfix release â€” for example if
a real world use case shows an issue that we did not think about. Should you need to use these classes directly, keep in
mind that, even though chances for changes are getting lower and lower, these classes are **not covered** by our BC
promise.

## Contao Twig
All right! Get yourself a big coffee and start your deep-dive into the Contao-Twig ecosystem here:
 1) [â†’ Understanding the architecture](architecture)
 2) [â†’ Creating and adjusting templates](creating-templates)
 3) [â†’ Debugging](debugging)

Not ready, yet? Following up is a short *Twig 101* on how to get started if you are new to Twig.


## Getting started
Twig is Symfony's default way to write templates. It's fast, safe and easily extensible. Contrary to PHP templates, Twig
templates won't contain business logic which allows to share them more easily between designers and programmers. This
fact helps you maintain a clean separation between your presentation and data/logic layer.

Twig features a lot of powerful methods to structure and reuse your and other's templates, has an easy-to-use syntax to
access objects, built-in whitespace control, string interpolation features, macros, and â€” really â€” a ton moreâ€¦

If not for its user features, then because of the way it handles *encoding* (which allows us to transition to a saner and
more secure future!), Twig has been made a core requirement and will replace our old existing template system. 

#### Learning the syntax
Twig templates have their own syntax, but don't be afraid, you'll quickly find your way. Switch between the following
tabs to see how an example legacy PHP template would translate to an equivalent Twig template. In case you're new to
Contao, you might want to skip watching the old stuff and directly focus on the Twig side. ðŸ˜‰

{{< tabs groupId="twig">}}
{{% tab name="PHP" %}}
```html
<?php */ Old stuff */ ?>
<div class="about-me">
  <h2><?= $this->name ?></h2>
  <p>I am <?= round($this->age) ?> years old.</p>

  <ul class="hobby-list">
    <?php foreach $this->hobbies as $hobby: ?>
      <li><?= ucfirst($hobby) ?></li>
    <?php endforeach; ?>
  </ul>
</div>
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab name="Twig" %}}
```twig
{# New stuff! #}
<div class="about-me">
  <h2>{{ name }}</h2>
  <p>I am {{ age|round }} years old.</p>

  <ul class="hobby-list">
    {% for hobby in hobbies %}
      <li>{{ hobby|capitalize }}</li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
</div>
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{< /tabs >}}

 * To output variables wrap their name in curly braces `{{ foo }}`, 
 * to use keywords, like `for` to loop over an array, wrap them in `{%` and `%}`,
 * to further process any output, use [filters][Twig Filters] `|foo` and [functions][Twig Functions] `bar()`.
 * Finally, to add comments, put them between `{#` and `#}`.

Twig is very [well documented][Twig Docs] - a good place to start is
the [Twig for template designers][Twig Template Designers Docs] section that covers syntax details as well as helpful
IDE plugins for autocompletion and syntax highlighting.

For quickly trying something out, you can use [Twig fiddle][Twig Fiddle] - an online playground. Take a look at
this [demo fiddle](https://twigfiddle.com/kctdqs) for instance.

#### Using twig-extra bundles
Extending Twig yourself is easy but there are also already a lot of Twig extensions in the wild, including some official
ones, called the [twig-extra][TwigExtra] bundles. In Contao, the latter can simply be installed with composer or the
Contao Manager and are directly ready to be used (no need to configure or register anything).

```bash
composer require twig/intl-extra
```

```twig
{{ '1000000'|format_currency('EUR') }}

{# â‚¬1,000,000.00 #}
```

#### Extending Twig
We also encourage you to extend Twig yourself. There are a lot of extension points with filters and functions being the
easiest to start with. Have a look in the [official docs][Extending Twig Docs], where things are explained in more 
detail. 

{{% example "Creating your first Twig filter" %}}
Let's implement a simple `|rot13` filter in our application, that will scramble strings by shifting every letter by 13
places in the alphabet (`Abcd` &rarr; `Nopq`). That's apparently so useful, that PHP already has a built-in function for
this: `str_rot13()`. Nice.

Go ahead and create a class, that is extending `Twig\Extension\AbstractExtension` in the `src/Twig` folder of your
application. You can have as many extensions as you want but in an application, you would typically only use a single
`AppExtension`. Then, override the `getFilters()` function and register a new filter:

```php
// src/Twig/AppExtension.php

namespace App\Twig;

use Twig\Extension\AbstractExtension;
use Twig\TwigFilter;

class AppExtension extends AbstractExtension
{
    public function getFilters(): array
    {
        return [
            // Register a new filter named "rot13" and tell Twig which method to execute
            new TwigFilter('rot13', [$this, 'rotateString']),
        ];
    }

    // The first argument ($value) is the string, the filter is applied on
    public function rotateString(string $value): string
    {
        return str_rot13($value);
    }
}
```

Andâ€¦ that's all there is to it. Our filter is now ready and can be used in **any** template:
```twig
{% set secret_cms = 'Pbagnb' %}

Turns out "{{ secret_cms }}" means "{{ secret_cms|rot13 }}".

{# Turns out "Pbagnb" means "Contao". #}
```
