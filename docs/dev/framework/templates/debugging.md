In this article, we discuss how to analyze and resolve Twig-related issues. Twig is a compiled language, that means,
that errors regarding the syntax will already be found and raised during compilation — with helpful exception messages
(well most of the time). But there are other occasions: from simply being stuck when writing a template to resolving
runtime errors, i.e. those that only happen when the templates are finally executed.

1) How to avoid errors in the first place with DX things like [autocompletion](#ide-support)?
2) What [inheritance hierarchy](#debug--contao-twig-command) did the system build from my templates?  
3) How do I debug [runtime issues](#runtime-issues)? 


## IDE support

A good IDE can help your understanding a lot by providing autocompletion for syntax, files and objects. Giving your
files a `.twig` extension is enough to enable language support in most modern IDEs.

If you are using *PhpStorm* with the (excellent!) [Symfony plugin][PhpStorm Symfony plugin], you can go a step further
and get context-sensitive autocompletion. If your IDE can do the following things as well, please feel free to edit this
page and include it as well!

#### Namespace mapping (PhpStorm only)

In the `dev` environment, the `ContaoFilesystemLoaderWarmer` will dump a special `ide-twig.json` file into your `var`
directory, that includes a mapping of all registered namespaces and filesystem locations. With that, you'll get
template name autocompletion, even for the managed `@Contao` namespace.  

![Getting autocompletion for template names]({{% asset "images/dev/framework/twig-file-autocompletion.png" %}}?classes=shadow)

You will now also able to navigate to referenced templates by holding down `Ctrl` and clicking on the name. 

#### Type resolution (PhpStorm only)

You can also get full autocompletion for template parameters like you would inside a code file. For explicitly stated
templates in `render()` calls, the types can get inferred, for other cases (most of the time in Contao), you can still
get autocompletion by adding a type annotation inside the template:

![Getting autocompletion on variables]({{% asset "images/dev/framework/twig-type-autocompletion.png" %}}?classes=shadow)



## debug:contao-twig command

A Contao application can consist of hundreds of templates, and they are all part of a big *template hierarchy*. This is
why there is the `debug:contao-twig` command, that helps you get a visual representation of what is going on. 

You should always use it, if the template, you are expecting, is not available or an unwanted template takes it place.
Pass a template name prefix as the first argument to filter the results. The optional parameter `--tree` renders the
result in tree form (handy, for example, when you want to find templates and their variants).

```bash
debug:contao-twig
debug:contao-twig --theme my_theme
debug:contao-twig content_element/te
debug:contao-twig content_element/text --tree
```

The output also includes a short preview of the file as well as the identified blocks. If you also want to include
templates of a certain theme, use the `--theme <slug>` option and pass in the [theme slug](../architecture#themes).

{{% notice tip %}}
Here is a typical problem that you could narrow down using the `debug:contao-twig` command: Are you missing a template,
and, while debugging, found out, that it is indeed there, just without the directories in the template name? So for example
`@Contao/foo.html.twig` instead of `@Contao/content_element/foo.html.twig`? Then, you are most likely missing a
`.twig-root` file — refer to [this explanation](../architecture#twig-root) to find out more!

## Runtime issues

The issues, that are the hardest to deal with, are those that only happen at runtime. This could be an unexpected type
passed to the template, a missing parameter, and so on…

#### Dumping

The most straightforward way to understand what's going on, is to use the [`dump()` function][Twig Docs dump function].
It is basically a wrapper around `var_dump` and will generate a nicely formatted listing of your template parameters
with types. The result is rendered in place:
```twig
{# Dump everything #}
{{ dump() }}

{# Only dump what's inside "a" and "b" #}
{{ dump(a, b) }}
```
![Dumping inside the markup]({{% asset "images/dev/framework/twig-dump.png" %}}?classes=shadow)


Alternatively, you can use the `{% dump %}` tag from the Symfony Twig bridge. With this tag, the dump output won't be
displayed, but send to the `VarDumper` component instead. You can then find the results, when clicking the target icon
in the *Symfony Web Debug Toolbar*:
```twig
{# Dump everything #}
{% dump %}

{# Only dump what's inside "a" and "b" #}
{% dump a, b %}
```
![Dumping into the Symfony Web Debug Toolbar]({{% asset "images/dev/framework/twig-web-debug-toolbar.png" %}}?classes=shadow)

{{% notice tip %}}
In `dev` mode, the profiler extension will add profiling statements to all compiled templates. The results are also
available in the Symfony Web Debug Toolbar (check the Twig section): template, block and macro calls, a listing of all
utilized templates with counts, dependencies and render times. Neat!
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice warning %}}
Dumping, especially without constraining to a parameter, could pose a security risk in your application if it would
happen on a productive site (the global `app` variable for instance would leak the request stack including things like
server variables!). That is why it is only available in the `dev` environment.
{{% /notice %}}

#### File cache and debugging breakpoints

The way Twig is configured in Contao (or really a regular Symfony application), is to dump the compiled templates onto
disk as a PHP file. When rendering, the (one-time) compiled file is then simply executed. This is very effective,
especially if you consider things like opcode caching that can be fully utilized with this strategy.

{{% notice tip %}}
In the `dev` environment, you'll find the resulting files in your `var/cache/dev/twig` directory. For each template, a
separate file will be created (there are some exceptions, but you'll find your way) — the file name is a hash, though.
To find a file, you can search for a comment `/* @Contao/<name>.html.twig */`, that Twig adds to the very top of the
file.
{{% /notice %}}

For each block or macro, you'll find a function. The used Twig functions, filters, block calls and the like were
translated to PHP code. You'll also see the escaper in action if you look for lines that start like
`echo $this->env->getFilter('escape')->…`. 

For tough problems, you might want to set breakpoints inside these files and step through them line. Yes, in the end 
they are just regular PHP files, that you can debug with tools like XDebug. Some IDEs (such as PHPStorm) even support
direct debugging in the template files itself, if you tell them where to find the cache files:
