With the file management you can manage files and folders on your server and transfer files from your local computer to 
the server. By default, user resources are stored in the Contao folder `files`. Contao's database-driven filesystem 
stores file information in the database and references the entries by their 
[UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifier)](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_Unique_Identifier). A UUID is unique 
across systems and looks like this: `bb643d42-0026-ba97-11e3-ccd717221c8a`.
