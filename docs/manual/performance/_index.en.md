Here you can find various information about the performance of Contao.

Of course, there are other factors that have a decisive influence on the performance of Contao, too, such as

- The choice of the used web server (Apache, Nginx, LiteSpeed, ...)
- The choice of the operating system used (Linux, Windows, ...)
- The choice of the physical and virtual file system (HDD vs. SSD, NFS, ...)

However, many users will not be able to influence this directly because they are customers of a hosting provider of their choice and will be faced with a fait accompli.

It is also important to note that there is not **one** perfect setup for Contao. This section of the documentation is intended to serve as a small collection of best practices and to show you what you can do to squeeze as much speed out of your installation as possible.
