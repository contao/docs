Here you can find curated tips regarding the performance of Contao.

Of course, there are other factors that influence the performance of Contao, such as

- The choice of the web server (Apache, Nginx, LiteSpeed, ...)
- The choice of the operating system used (Linux, Windows, ...)
- The choice of the physical and virtual file system (HDD vs. SSD, NFS, ...)

However, many users will not have a say on those as they are customers of a hosting provider of their choice an
are therefore faced with a fait accompli.

Moreover, it has to be said that there is not **the one** perfect setup for Contao. This section of the documentation
is intended to serve as a small collection of best practices and to show you what you can do to squeeze as much speed
out of your installation as possible.
