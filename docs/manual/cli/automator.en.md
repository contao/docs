This command is an interface to the `Automator` class of Contao. It mainly consists
of common tasks around the maintenance of a Contao installation.

```sh
$> php vendor/bin/contao-console contao:automator [<task>]
```

The command itself can be executed without providing a task. It will then
ask for it. The following tasks are available.
