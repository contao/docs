## contao:user:list

Lists existing Contao users:

| `--column=COLUMN` | The columns display in the table (multiple values are allowed) |
| `--format=FORMAT` | Output format ( txt, json ) |

```bash
php vendor/bin/contao-console contao:user:list --help
```


## contao:user:create

## contao:user:password

Change of a user password (requires a username as an argument). If the command is executed without options, 
the required information is requested interactively.

```bash
php vendor/bin/contao-console contao:user:password --help
```

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--help`   | Options overview |
| `--username` | The username of the back end user |
| `--password` | The new password (using this option is not recommended for security reasons) |
| `--require-change` | Require the user to change the password on their next login |


{{% notice warning %}}
For security reasons, outside of a [local installation](/en/guides/local-installation/), a password should not be passed 
as an option directly on the CLI, as the password is then saved in plain text in the bash history.
