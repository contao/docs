Template changes are not necessary if you only need an additional CSS ID or CSS class. For most Contao components, you can enter them in the "Expert settings" section. The corresponding names are taken from the templates and displayed in the source code.

In [debug mode](../../system/debug-modus/), the template names in the HTML source code are displayed as comments, so you can see which template is being used.
