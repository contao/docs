After you have selected the right page types for your pages, you can configure them to suit your needs. The configuration options vary depending on the page type.

## Page aliases

The **alias** of a page is a unique and meaningful reference that you can use to access a page in your browser. If you leave this field empty when creating a page, Contao will automatically generate the alias. Each alias must be unique within the domain used, i.e. it can only occur once.

{{% notice warning %}}
The alias of the home page should always be `index`. Only then the generated URL for this page will be an empty request. 
{{% /notice %}}

## Metadata

The metadata of a page mostly refers to the corresponding meta tags in the header area of the HTML page. You can use them to define the title and description of a page, among other things.

**Page title:** The page title is used in the `<title>` tag of the website and often appears in search results of Google and Co. It should not contain more than 65 characters, because many search engines will simply cut off longer titles. If no page title is defined, the page name is used as a fallback.

**Output in source code:**
```html
<title>Page title</title>
```

**Robots tag:** The robots tag defines how search engines treat a page.

- *index:* add the page to the search index
- *follow:* follow the links on the page
- *noindex:* do not include the page in the search index
- *nofollow:* do not follow the links on the page

The default case is *index,follow*, because we want Google and other search engines to include our pages in the search index. However, certain pages, such as the imprint or the registration page, can be excluded from indexing using the setting *noindex,nofollow*.

**Output in source code:**
```html
<meta name="robots" content="index,follow">
```

**Description of the page:** The description of a page is indexed by all common search engines just like the page title and is displayed in the search results, if no context information is available for the search term. The recommended length of a description is between 150 and 300 characters. The meta description of a page is an important tool for search engine optimization, so you should take the time to provide each page with a unique description.

**Output in source code:**
```html
<meta name="description" content="Description of the page (between 150 and 300 characters).">
```

## Further settings for website roots

For pages of the type "Website root" there are additional input fields available, with which you can overwrite certain 
global settings per website.

{{% notice info %}}
**Before** Contao **4.10** the settings within the sections _URL settings_ and _Language setting_ were located within the 
section _DNS settings_.
{{% /notice %}}

### URL settings

The URL settings together with the language settings determine which website root Contao shows, depending on the domain
and the language of the visitor's browser. These settings also define the format of the URLs generated by Contao.

**Domain name:** If you want a website in your site structure to be accessible under a specific domain such as "company.com", you can enter it here. If a visitor then calls up "company.com" in his browser, they will be automatically redirected to the corresponding website root of a website.

**Protocol (Use HTTPS):** If your website is reachable via HTTPS then this setting must be configured accordingly. This
setting is called **Protocol** since Contao **4.10** and allows to select between `http://` and `https://`. In Contao **4.9**
visitors will be automatically redirected to HTTPS if this setting is enabled. Starting with Contao **4.10**, visitors will
be automatically redirected to either `http://` or `https://`.

{{% notice warning %}}
If you use an SSL certificate for your domain then you _must_ change this setting from `http://` to `https://` under Contao
**4.10** and up. Otherwise you might get an infinite redirect in the front end, if your hosting environment automatically
redirects from `http://` to `https://`.
{{% /notice %}}

{{< version "4.10" >}}

**URL prefix:** With this setting you can add an optional URL prefix to all page aliases under this website root. As mentioned
above this setting is only available since Contao **4.10**. Previously you could only influence the prefix through the
`contao.prepend_locale` setting, which would automatically prepend the website root's language to the URL. Now this prefix
can be freely configured, independent of the respective language.

{{< version "4.10" >}}

**URL suffix:** This setting allows you to change or remove the "URL suffix". This suffix will be appended to the alias
when generating the URL of a page.

{{< version "4.5" >}}

**Alias settings:** The slug generator allows you to select an individual character set for automatically generated aliases.

| Alias Settings | Declaration |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Unicode numbers and small letters | The alias `über-uns` is generated from the page name "About us". |
| Unicode numbers and letters | The alias `Über-uns` is generated from the page name "About us". |
| ASCII numbers and small letters | The alias `ueber-uns` is generated from the page name "About us". |
| ASCII numbers and letters | The alias `Ueber-uns` is generated from the page name "About us". |

For the creation of the alias, the defined language is also relevant in some cases. For instance the German word "über"
would be converted to "ueber" while the finish word "eläinkö" would be converted to "elainko".

{{% notice note %}}
This setting is located within the section _Alias settings_ in Contao **4.5** through **4.9**.
{{% /notice %}}

{{< version "4.10" >}}

**Enable folder URLs:** Here you can activate folder structures in page aliases. This will add the aliases that exist in 
the page hierarchy to the alias, e.g. the page "Download" in the page path "Docs &gt; Install" will use the alias 
`docs/install/download.html` instead of just `download.html`.

Since Contao **4.10** this setting can be configured per website root. In previous Contao versions this setting could
only be configured globally via [a system setting][SystemSettingFolderUrl].


#### Legacy Routing Mode

{{< version "4.10" >}}

The settings **URL prefix** and **URL suffix** as well as **Disable language redirect** are only available if the so called
"legacy routing" mode is disabled via the `contao.legacy_routing` setting. When not disabled the URL generation will continue
to be influenced only via the `contao.prepend_locale` and `contao.url_suffix` setting.

```yml
# config/config.yml
contao:
    legacy_routing: false
```

**However**, be advised that disabling the legacy routing mode also disables the following hooks:

* [`getRootPageFromUrl`][GetRootPageFromUrlHook]
* [`getPageIdFromUrl`][GetPageIdFromUrlHook]

{{% notice warning %}}
If you have any extensions installed that still rely on either of these hooks, then you must either keep legacy routing
enabled or you need to remove or replace these extensions. Otherwise an error in the front end will occur.
{{% /notice %}}


### Language settings

**Language**: Here you can set the language of the website root. Languages are recorded via their primary subtag according to ISO 639-1, e.g. `de` for German or `en` for English.

**Language fallback:** Contao always searches for a website root in the language that a visitor has selected in his browser. If there is only a German website root, an English visitor would only see the error message "No pages found" because there is no website in his language.

To avoid this, you can define a certain website root as a fallback, which freely translated means "welcome page" or "alternative page". This fallback page will then catch all visitors who cannot be assigned to a website root due to their language settings.

So make sure to always define a website root as the language fallback. Otherwise your website can only be accessed by German visitors! Also the robots of the search engines that index your website usually speak English and would also be excluded without a language fallback. Your pages would then never appear on Google despite careful optimization.

{{< version "4.10" >}}

**Disable language redirect:** When using a website with multiple languages within the same Domain then Contao will automatically
redirect to the website root of the browser's language (or the fallback language otherwise) whenever the domain is requested
without any other parameters. You can exclude certin (or all) website roots from this automatic redirect through this setting.


### Global settings

**E-mail address of the website administrator:** Here you can overwrite the e-mail address of the system administrator defined in the backend settings for a specific website. This address is used to send notifications about blocked accounts or newly registered users, for example. If you have multiple websites within the site structure, it may be useful to set a separate administrator for each website, who will only receive notifications from his website. You can also use the following notation to add a name to your email address:

```text
Kevin Jones [kevin.jones@example.com]
```

**Date format:** Here you can overwrite the date format defined in the backend settings. In contrast to the backend, which only supports numeric formats, you can also use text formats in the frontend.

**Time format:** Here you can overwrite the time format defined in the backend settings. Text formats are also supported in the frontend.

**Date and time format:** Here you can override the date and time format defined in the backend settings. Text formats are supported.

Contao supports all date and time formats that can be parsed with the [PHP function date](https://www.php.net/manual/de/function.date.php). To convert any input into a UNIX timestamp, only numeric formats (j, d, m, n, y, Y, g, G, h, H, i, s) are allowed in the back end.

Here are some examples of valid dates and times:

| Specifications | Declaration |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Y-m-d | YYYY-MM-DD, international ISO-8601, for example `2005-01-28` |
| m/d/Y | MM/DD/YYYY, English format, for example `01/28/2005` |
| d.m.Y | DD.MM.YYYY, German format, for example `28.01.2005` |
| y-n-j | JJ-M-T, without leading zeros, e.g. `05-1-28` |
| Ymd | YYYYMMDD, time stamp, for example `20050128` |
| H:i:s | 24 hours, minutes and seconds, for example `20:36:59` |
| g:i | 12 hours without leading zeros and minutes, for example `8:36` |

{{< version "4.8" >}}

**Enforce two-factor authentication:** Here you can enforce two-factor authentication for all members (frontend). Select a page that visitors will be redirected to when they set up the two-factor authentication.


### XML Sitemap

Contao automatically creates an XML sitemap from the page structure of the website that can be read and analyzed by Google. To submit the sitemap URL to Google you need a Google account.

**Create an XML Sitemap:** Here you activate the creation of the XML Sitemap.

**Sitemap file name:** Enter the name of the Sitemap file here without the file extension `.xml`. Contao will automatically add the file extension when saving the file.


## Layout settings

A page layout is a prerequisite for Contao to be able to display a page in the frontend at all. If no page layout has been assigned or inherited, Contao will show an error saying "No layout specified" in the front end.

**Assign a layout:** Here you can assign a page layout to a page. The assignment automatically applies to all sub pages without a page layout.

**Page layout:** Here you can see all available page layouts grouped by themes. You activate a theme by assigning a page layout.

## Cache settings

In the cache settings you can define if and how long a page should be cached. Cached pages load much faster because they do not have to be generated by Contao and they do not need a connection to the database for delivery.

**Set cache timeouts:** Here you can assign a cache time to a page. If you do not select this option, the cache settings are inherited from a parent page.

**Private cache timeout (Client cache timeout):** Allows you to assign a cache time to a page. This sets the time in seconds after which the browser will consider the page out of date.

**Shared cache  timeout (Server cache timeout):** Here you can assign a cache time to a page. This defines the time in seconds after which the page is considered obsolete by a shared cache.

Note that for security reasons, pages are only cached if they are not protected and no user is logged on to the backend. Otherwise, there is a risk that confidential data is written to the cache and accidentally displayed in the frontend. So don't be surprised if your password-protected pages don't show up in the cache despite their assigned expiration time.

{{< version "4.8" >}}

**Always load from shared cache:** Always load this page from the shared cache, even if a member is logged in. Note that in this case you will not be able to personalize the page for logged in members.

## Access rights

Via access rights you define which users in the backend (!) are allowed to access a page and what they can do with this page and the articles it contains. Similar to the Unix permissions system, each page belongs to a specific user and user group and has three levels of access:

- Access as owner of a page
- Access as member of the group of a page
- Access as any other back end user

For example, the "Company" page is assigned access rights and belongs to the user h.lewis and the user group _News_. Both the user and everyone in the user group can edit articles on the page, but only the owner, h.lewis, and you the administrator can edit the page and change its title.

![Assign access rights](/de/layout/site-structure/images/en/assign-access-rights.png?classes=shadow)

**Assign access rights:** Here you can assign access rights to a page. If you do not select this option, the access rights will be inherited from a parent page.

**Owner:** Here you can set the owner of the page.

**Group:** Here you define the group of the page.

**Access rights**: Here you assign the rights to the individual access levels.

For more information on the permissions system and the configuration of users and user groups, see the [system settings](/en/system/settings/) page.

## Access protection

In contrast to access rights, which define the rights in the back end, access protection refers to the protection of a page from access in the front end. Visitors must first log in with their username and password before they can access the page. Otherwise they would only see an error page.

**Protect page:** Here you can restrict access to a page. If you do not select this option, access protection is inherited from a parent page.

**Allowed member groups:** Here you can define which member groups are allowed to access the page. To configure members and member groups, see the System Administration page.

## Expert settings

There may be pages within your site structure that are available in the frontend but should not appear in the menu. Or there could be pages that should only be displayed until a user logs in (for example, the registration page). You can configure such special wishes in the expert settings.

**CSS class:** Here you assign a CSS class to the page, which is used in the body tag of the HTML page as well as in the navigation modules. This way you can create CSS formatting for a specific page or menu item.

**Show in the sitemap:** If desired, Contao creates an XML sitemap for each website that you can submit to Google[ (XML sitemap](#xml-sitemap)). By default, this includes all public pages and not those hidden in the menu. You can change this behavior per page if needed:

- **Default:** Use the default settings.
- **Always display:** The page is always displayed in the XML Sitemap, even if, for example, it is hidden in the menu and would not normally be displayed.
- **Never display:** The page is excluded from the XML Sitemap.

**Hide in menu:** If you select this option, the page will not be displayed in the menu of your website, but you can still access the page - if it has been published - via a direct link or in a frontend module.

Contao indexes the finished pages of your website and creates a search index that you can search with the frontend module "search engine". With this setting, you can exclude certain pages from the indexing process. In the backend settings, you can also disable the search function completely.

**Do not search:** Here you can exclude a page from the search.

**Show only guests:** If you select this option, the link to the page will be automatically hidden from the navigation menu of the website once a member has logged in. This is useful for the Login and Registration pages, for example.

{{< version "4.5" >}}

**Element required:** If you select this option, this page will show error page 404 if the URL does not contain an alias for an element.

## Keyboard navigation

From section [Backend shortcuts](/de/administrationsbereich/backend-tastaturkuerzel/) you already know that Contao supports navigation using shortcuts. This not only has a positive effect on accessibility but also speeds up the workflow. For this reason, the feature is also available in the frontend and each page can optionally be provided with a keyboard shortcut and a tab index.

**Tab Index:** By default, you can use the Tab key to jump from top to bottom through the navigation menu. However, you can specify an individual order by assigning a number between 1 and 32,767 to each page, and the tab will then follow your sorting in ascending order instead of the default order.

**Shortcut keys:** A shortcut key is a single character associated with a page. Visitors to your site can then access that page directly from the keyboard. This function is especially required for accessible websites.


## Redirecting

The following settings are only available for redirect pages. Contao distinguishes between internal and external redirects [page types](/en/layout/site-structure/pages-as-central-elements/#page-types).

**Redirect type:** Here you can specify whether the redirect is temporary (HTTP 302) or permanent (HTTP 301). The redirection type is especially important for search engine optimization.

**Redirect page:** Here you specify the target page for internal redirects.

**Link address:** Here you can enter the destination URL in case of external redirection. You must use the protocol `https://` for redirection to another website, the protocol for linking an e-mail address `mailto:` and the protocol `tel:` for linking a phone number.

**Open in a new window:** The target page will open in a new browser window.

**Further settings for error pages**

With error pages, you can optionally redirect visitors to another page instead of displaying a message. For example, if an unregistered visitor comes across the error 403 page when trying to access a protected page, you could redirect them directly to the login page.

**Forward to another page:** Here you activate the auto-redirect.

## Publication

As long as a page is not published, it practically does not exist in the frontend and cannot be accessed by visitors. In addition to manual publishing, Contao also offers the possibility to activate pages automatically on a specific date. This way you can, for example, apply for a limited time offer.

**Publish page:** Here you can publish a page.

**Show from:** Here you activate a page on a specific date.

**Show until:** Here you deactivate a page at a certain date.
