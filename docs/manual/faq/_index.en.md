Check the [SMTP details](/en/system/settings/#e-mail-sending-configuration) of your hoster in your `parameters.yml` or add them if missing.

or via the console.

{{% expand "Can I use a different e-mail Address as sender for forms?" %}}
The e-mail address set in "Settings &gt; E-mail address of the system administrator" is also used as the sender for e-mails sent by the form generator. 
You can enter an additional e-mail address in the "Site structure" section for the "Starting point of a website" page type. 
This E-Mail address will then be used as the sender.
Since Contao 4.10 you can [set different e-mail configurations](/en/system/settings/#different-e-mail-configurations-and-sender-addresses) per website starting point, form and newsletter channel.

Since Contao 4.10, you can freely define the URL prefix, independently of the language.
