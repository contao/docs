To speed up the workflow when working with Contao, there are several keyboard shortcuts in the back end that allow you to
call up certain commands directly. For example, the `Save` button is always located at the end of an input form, so that 
it can only be clicked with the mouse when the page is completely scrolled down.

Normally, this is not a problem, because when filling out a form you work from top to bottom. But 
if you later want to change only a single value at the beginning of the form, the button is not accessible without scrolling. 
In this case, you are able to access the keyboard shortcut {{< accesskey "s" >}} even without scrolling 
to the destination.


## General keyboard shortcuts
