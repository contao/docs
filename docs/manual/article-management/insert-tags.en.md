Insert tags are placeholders that are replaced by specific values when a page is output. With insert tags you can, for example, create a link to a page or an article, insert environment variables or read user properties. Insert tags can be used everywhere in Contao.

An insert tag always starts with two opening curly brackets, followed by a keyword and two closing curly brackets, e.g. `{{date}}`. Many insert tags require an additional argument that is written with two colons after the keyword, e.g. `{{link::12}}`.

## Link elements

## Miscellaneous

The following insert tags allow you to perform various tasks, such as inserting the current date or a Lightbox image.

| Insert tag | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| `{{date}}` | This tag will be replaced with the current date according to the global date format. |
| `{{date::*}}` | This tag will be replaced with the current date according to an individual date format. Contao supports all date and time formats that can be parsed with the [PHP function date](https://www.php.net/manual/de/function.date.php). `{{date::d.m.Y}}` |
| `{{format_date::*::*}}` | {{< version "4.10" >}} This tag can be used to format a UNIX timestamp or a *standardized date*. The first parameter is the timestamp or date. The second parameter is the date format (see `{{date::*}}`) and is optional. If the date format is not specified, the date is output according to the global date format. This tag makes sense in combination with other tags or simple tokens to (re)format the output date or timestamp. Examples: `{{date_format::{{user::tstamp}}::d.m.Y}}`, `{{date_format::##member_dateAdded##}}`. If the date format cannot be recognized automatically, it can be used instead `{{convert_date::*::*::*}}`. |

The third parameter is the new date format (see `{{date::*}}`) and is optional. If the date format is not specified, the date is output according to the global date format. This tag is useful in combination with other tags or simple tokens to reformat the output date. Example: `{{convert_date::##some_date##::Y, j.n.::j. F Y}}` (converts `2020, 12.7.`to `12. Juli 2020`), for example. |

| `{{email_url::*}}` | This tag is replaced only by the encrypted e-mail address. |
| `{{post::*}}` | This tag can be used to read and display a specified post variable. Can be used, for example, to access individual fields of a sent form. |

| `{{iflng::*}}` | This tag is completely removed if the language of the page does not match the tag language. You can create language specific tags: `{{iflng::en}}Your name{{iflng::de}}Ihr Name{{iflng}}` |
| `{{ifnlng::*}}` | This tag will be removed completely if the language of the page matches the tag language. You can create language specific tags this way: `{{ifnlng::de}}Your name{{ifnlng}}{{iflng::de}}Ihr Name{{iflng}}` |
| `{{image::*}}` | This tag is replaced with the preview of an image (where \* can be a database ID, a UUID, or a path from the file system): `{{image::58ca4a90-2d30-11e4-8c21-0800200c9a66?width=200&height=150}}`**width**: Width of the preview image **,height**: Height of the preview image, **alt**: Alternative text, **class**: CSS class, **rel**: rel attribute (e.g. "lightbox"),mode:  **Mode ("**proportional", "crop" or "box"). |

| `{{label::*}}` | This tag is replaced with a translation. The first parameter is the name of a language file or an acronym ( `CNT`for example, for countries or `LNG`for languages).

| `[&]` | `&amp;` = ampersand ( `&`) |
| `[lt]` | `&lt;` = less than ( `<`) |
| `[gt]` | `&gt;` = greater than ( `>`) |
| `[nbsp]` | `&nbsp;` = non-breaking spaceIf you want to prevent the break between two words, a protected space must be inserted. e.g. `Contao[nbsp]CMS` |
| `[-]` | `&shy;` = soft hyphenThe word is wrapped if there is not enough space. The separation is done with a hyphen. e.g. `Donau[-]dampf[-]schiff[-]fahrts[-]gesell[-]schaft` |
| `[{]`, `[}]` | Replaced in the frontend with `{{` bzw. `}}`. This enables you to display insert tags in the frontend, for example, to explain them. |
