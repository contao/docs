Most maintenance tasks in Contao are automated so that you can concentrate on your real work. Sometimes, however, it 
might be necessary to manually start the system maintenance tasks that are otherwise performed automatically.


## Maintenance mode

This feature allows you to put the Contao instance into a "maintenance mode". While this mode is active, the front end
is not reachable for regular visitors. Instead an appropriate message is shown. The back end is accessible as usual,
logged in back end users can also visit the front end normally.

This mode is useful, if more in depth work needs to be done in the back end, the effects of which should not be
immediately visible in the front end.


## Crawler

Pages are automatically indexed when you access them in the front end (unless you are logged into the backend at the same 
time), so you don't normally have to worry about the search index. However, if you have updated many pages at once, it is 
more convenient to rebuild the search index manually than to call up all changed pages one by one in the browser.

The crawler can also check for broken links, when enabled.

{{% notice note %}}
In versions prior to Contao **4.9** this section is called **Rebuild search index**. The feature of being able to check
for broken links is not available there.
{{% /notice %}}

{{< version "4.9" >}}

The crawler can also be executed directly from the command line:

```sh
$ vendor/bin/contao-console contao:crawl
```

However since there is no HTTP request context available on the console, a domain must be defined. For this reason you
should always define the domain in the website root settings, even if you only use one domain in your Contao instance.
Alternatively you can define the default domain for the console via configuration parameters:

```yml
# config/parameters.yml
parameters:
    router.request_context.host: 'example.org'
    router.request_context.scheme: 'https'
```

You can find more information in the [Symfony Routing Documentation][SymfonyUrlCommands].


### Indexing protected pages

To allow the search of protected pages, you must first enable this feature in the [backend settings][BackendSettings]. Use this feature 
very carefully and always exclude personalized pages from the search!

{{% notice note %}}
Since Contao **4.9** this is enabled in the application configuration:

```yml
# config/config.yml
contao:
    search:
        # Enable indexing of protected pages.
        index_protected: true
```
{{% /notice %}}

Then create a new front end user and allow them to access the protected pages to be indexed.

Later during the search, the protected pages will of course only appear in the results if the registered front end user 
is allowed to access them.


## Purge data

In addition to the user-generated content, Contao stores various system data that is used the search or for restoring 
deleted records or previous versions. You can manually clean this data, for example to remove old thumbnails or to 
update the XML sitemaps after a change in the page structure.
