The system settings slowly but surely leave the backend. Basic system settings influence Contao as an application and 
therefore there is a chance that a wrong setting will render the system non-functional. If this happens, you will not 
be able to undo the settings and restore the system because you will not be able to log in anymore. For this reason, 
most settings are configured outside of Contao via the `config.yml`, or can be configured via the Contao Manager in the future.


## Settings


### Global configuration

**E-mail address of the system administrator:** This is the address to which notifications about e.g. locked accounts or 
newly registered users are sent. You can also use the following notation to add a name to the email address:

```text
Kevin Jones [kevin.jones@example.com]
```


### Date and time

**Date and time format:** All date and time formats must be entered as used with the PHP 
[date](https://www.php.net/manual/de/function.date.php) function. Contao processes only numeric formats in the backend, 
i.e. the letters j, d, m, n, y, Y, g, G, h, H, i and s.

Here are some examples of valid date and time specifications:

| Information | Explanation |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Y-m-d | YYYY-MM-DD, international ISO-8601, for example `2005-01-28` |
| m/d/Y | MM/DD/YYYY, English format, for example `01/28/2005` |
| d.m.Y | DD.MM.YYYY, German format, for example `28.01.2005` |
| y-n-j | YY-M-D, without leading zeros, e.g. `05-1-28` |
| Ymd | YYYYMMDD, Unix timestamp, for example `20050128` |
| H:i:s | 24 hours, minutes and seconds, e.g. `20:36:59` |
| g:i | 12 hours without leading zeros and minutes, e.g. `8:36` |

**Time zone:** You should set the timezone before you create your website because Contao stores all dates as 
[Unix timestamps](https://www.php.net/time) and Contao will not adjust these, if the timezone is changed.


### Back end configuration

**Do not collapse elements:** In the "Parent View", Contao displays the elements in a shortened form for clarity 
reasons. Individual elements can be unfolded using a navigation icon if needed. Select this option to disable the 
feature completely.

**Items per page:** In the [Listing Records](/en/administration-area/list-data-records/#sort-and-filter-records) 
section, you learned that Contao limits the number of records per page to 30 by default. You can change this value here. 
Higher values mean a longer loading time.

**Maximum items per page:** To prevent an inexperienced user from displaying 5000 records at once and thus 
exceeding the PHP memory limit, you can specify the maximum number of records that can be displayed per page.

#### Additional back end settings:

{{< version "4.11" >}}

Some additional parameters can be configured via the `config/config.yml`.

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `attributes` | Adds HTML attributes to the `<body>` tag in the back end. The attribute name must be a valid HTML attribute name - it is automatically prefixed with `data-`. |
| `custom_css` | Adds custom style sheets to the back end. The assets must be publicly accessible via URL! |
| `custom_js` | Adds custom JavaScript files to the back end. The assets must be publicly accessible via URL! |
| `badge_title` | Configures the title of the badge in the back end. |

The following config defines some example values: 

```yml
# config/config.yaml
contao:
    backend:
        attributes:
            app-name: 'My App'
            app-version: 1.2.3
        custom_css:
            - files/backend/custom.css
        custom_js:
            - files/backend/custom.js
        badge_title: develop
```

### Front end configuration

**Enable folder URLs:** Here you can activate folder structures in page aliases. This will add the aliases that exist in 
the page hierarchy to the alias, e.g. the page "Download" in the page path "Docs &gt; Install" will use the alias 
`docs/install/download.html` instead of just `download.html`.

**Do not redirect empty URLs:** Allows you to disable the redirect of the "empty URL" to the start page of the browser's 
language respective website root when using the [legacy routing mode][LegacyRouting] without `contao.prepend_locale: true` 
*(not recommended)*.

**Deactivate the command scheduler:** Here you can disable the Periodic Command Scheduler and run the route 
`_contao/cron` using a real cron job (which you have to set up yourself). Starting with Contao **4.9** you can also
use the following command:

```
php vendor/bin/contao-console contao:cron
```


### Security settings

**Disable request tokens:** Here you can activate that the request tokens are not checked when submitting a form 
*(insecure!)*.

**Allowed HTML tags:** By default, Contao does not allow HTML tags in forms and removes them automatically when saving. 
For input fields where the use of HTML is desired, you can specify a list of allowed HTML tags here.


### Files and images

**Download file types:** Here you can define which file types may be downloaded from your server.

**Maximum GD image width:** Here you can define the maximum width of images that can still be processed via the GD image
process library. Any image exceeding this value will not be processed.

**Maximum GD image height:** Here you can define the maximum height of images that can still be processed via the GD image
process library. Any image exceeding this value will not be processed.


### Upload settings

**Upload file types:** Here you can define which file types can be uploaded to your server.

**Maximum upload file size:** Here you can define the maximum size of a file that can be uploaded to your server using 
the file manager. The entry is in bytes (1 MiB = 1024 KiB = 1,048,567 bytes). Larger files will be rejected.

**Maximum image width:** When uploading images, the file manager automatically checks the width of the image and 
compares it with the width you set here. If an image exceeds the maximum width, it will be reduced automatically.

**Maximum image height:** When uploading images, the file manager automatically checks their height and compares it with 
your default value. If an image exceeds the maximum height, it will be resized automatically.


### Search engine settings

**Enable searching:** If you select this option, Contao indexes the finished pages of your website and creates a search 
index from them. With the frontend module 
"[search engine](/en/layout/module-management/website-search/#configuration-of-the-search-module)", you can search this 
index.

**Index protected pages:** Select this option to index protected pages for your search. Use this feature with care and 
make sure to exclude personalized pages from the search.

{{% notice note %}}
Starting with version **4.9** a new search indexer is used. The settings **Enable searching** and 
**Index protected pages** are now configured via the `config/config.yml`.

```yml
contao:
    search:
        default_indexer:
            enable: true
        index_protected: false
```
{{% /notice %}}


### Default access rights

**Default page owner:** Here you can specify the default owner of the pages for which no access rights have been 
defined. For more information, see the Access Rights section.

**Default page group**: Here you can define to which group the pages for which no access rights are defined belong by 
default. For more information, see the Access Rights section.

**Default access rights:** Here you can set the default access rights for the pages for which no special access rights 
are defined. For more information, see the Access Rights section.


## parameters.yml

In the Contao Managed Edition, the parameters (e.g. database credentials) are stored in the `parameters.yml` file that 
is generated by the Contao installation tool. This file is usually excluded from the versioning process and can also 
contain additional entries such as the credentials for sending e-mails via SMTP.

The file `parameters.yml` is located in the folder `app/config/` and is created automatically when you install Contao.

{{% notice note %}}
From version **4.8** of Contao, the file is located directly in the root directory of the installation under `config/`.
{{% /notice %}}

The `parameters.yml` contains the following after installing Contao:

```yaml
# This file has been auto-generated during installation
parameters:
    database_host: …
    database_port: …
    database_user: …
    database_password: …
    database_name: …
    secret: …
```


## config.yml

The bundle configuration belongs in the `config.yml` and is located in the folder `app/config/`. If the file does not 
exist yet, it must be created. Contao automatically loads the `config_prod.yml` or `config_dev.yml` and if not available 
the `config.yml`.

This allows you to realize different configurations for your test or production environment (dev/prod) (e.g. more 
logging in debug mode). In addition, you can commit the `config.yml` configuration files to your repository, if your
project is versioned via Git for example.

{{% notice note %}}
From version **4.8** of Contao, the file is located directly in the root directory of the installation under `config/`.
{{% /notice %}}

You can access the default configuration for Contao from the command line:

```bash
php vendor/bin/contao-console config:dump-reference contao
```

You can get information about the current configuration this way:

```bash
php vendor/bin/contao-console debug:config contao

### localconfig

As mentioned in the config reference above the configuration key `contao.localconfig` allows you to set any configuration
that is defined via `$GLOBALS['TL_CONFIG']`, the default values of which can be overwritten via the 
`system/config/localconfig.php`. This is where Contao stores any settings that have been customised in the back end, i.e.
under _System_ » _Settings_. This form of storing settings is being phased out step by step. Some of the settings now
have a counterpart in the bundle configuration, others are e.g. set in the website root or within the back end user's
settings. 

However depending on the Contao version you are using there are still settings being used from the localconfig. Thus it 
can be useful to define them directly in your applications configuration (i.e. the `config.yml`) rather than the legacy 
`localconfig.php`. Not only because you might need it for your deployment flow, but also because some settings can _only_ 
be set manually - because they neither have a bundle configuration counterpart, nor is there another mean of setting them 
via the back end.

The following example defines the administrator's e-mail address via an environment variable and increases the undo period
to 60 days:

```yaml
# config/config.yaml
contao:
    localconfig:
        adminEmail: '%env(ADMIN_EMAIL)%'
        undoPeriod: 5184000
```

The following is a comprehensive list of localconfig configurations still in use and their description.

| `folderUrl` | [Enable folder URLs](#front-end-configuration). |
| `gdMaxImgHeight` | [Maximum GD image height](#files-and-images). |
| `gdMaxImgWidth` | [Maximum GD image width](#files-and-images). |
| `imageHeight` | [Maximum image height](#upload-settings). |
| `imageWidth` | [Maximum image width](#upload-settings). |
| `installPassword` | Stores the hashed value of the Contao Install Tool password. |
| `licenseAccepted` | Stores whether the license in the Contao Install Tool has been accepted. |
| `logPeriod` | Duration in seconds for how long entries in the Contao back end system log should be kept. Default: `604800`. |
| `maxFileSize` | [Maximum upload file size](#upload-settings). |
| `maxImageWidth` | Allows you to define a maximum image width for the front end _(deprecated)_. |
| `maxPaginationLinks` | Allows you define the number links shown in the automatically generated front end paginations. Default: `7`. |
| `maxResultsPerPage` | [Maximum items per page](#back-end-configuration). |
| `minPasswordLength` | Allows you to define the minimum password length for front end members and back end users. Default: `8`. |
| `requestTokenWhitelist` | Allows you to disable the [request token check][RequestTokens] for requests coming from the the hosts in this array _(deprecated)_. |
| `resultsPerPage` | [Items per page](#back-end-configuration). |
| `sessionTimeout` | Duration in seconds for how long a user session (front and back end) should stay valid. If you increase this value, you also might need to increase PHP's [session timeouts][PhpSessionSettings] (`session.cookie_lifetime` and `session.gc_maxlifetime`). Default: `3600`. |
| `timeFormat` | [Time format](#date-and-time). |
| `timeZone` | [Time zone](#date-and-time). |
| `undoPeriod` | Duration in seconds for how long deleted entries can still be restored. Default: `2592000`. |
| `uploadTypes` | [Upload file types](#upload-settings). |
| `useAutoItem` | Allows you to disable the usage of the so called _auto item_ _(not recommended)_. |
| `versionPeriod` | Duration in seconds for how long previous versions of edited entries should be kept. Default: `7776000`. |


## E-Mail sending configuration

To set up the sending of e-mails via an SMTP server, you need the following information from your host:

- The **hostname** of the SMTP server.
- The **user name** for the SMTP server.
- The **password** for the SMTP server.
- The **port number of** the SMTP server (587 / 465)
- The **encryption method** for the SMTP server (tls / ssl)

You will then insert this below the existing data in the `parameters.yml`

```yaml
# This file has been auto-generated during installation
parameters:
    …
    mailer_transport: smtp
    mailer_host: host.example.com
    mailer_user: mail@example.com
    mailer_password: 'mein-passwort'
    mailer_port: 465
    mailer_encryption: ssl
```

{{% notice warning %}}
**Clear cache** 
In order to enable these changes, the application cache must be rebuilt using the Contao Manager ("Maintenance" &gt; "Rebuild Production Cache") or alternatively via the command line. To do the latter you have to execute the following in the Contao installation directory:

```bash
php vendor/bin/contao-console cache:clear --env=prod --no-warmup
```
{{% /notice %}}

After that you can test the mail dispatch on the command line.

```bash
php vendor/bin/contao-console swiftmailer:email:send --from=absender@example.com --to=empfaenger@example.com --subject=testmail --body=testmail
```

{{% notice info %}}
This command is no longer available in Contao **4.10** and later.
{{% /notice %}}


### Different e-mail configurations and sender addresses

{{< version "4.10" >}}

In many cases, SMTP servers do not allow sending from any sender address. In most cases, the sender address must match 
the SMTP server access data used. Especially in multi-domain installations of Contao it might be important that the 
sender address of the emails that Contao sends matches the domain.

Since Contao **4.10**, it is possible to use multiple email configurations in Contao. These configurations can be 
selected per website root, per form and per newsletter channel. For each e-mail configuration, you can also set the 
sender that will be used for each e-mail sent by the selected e-mail configuration.

The configuration requires two steps. First, the available e-mail sending methods have to be set in the Symfony 
framework configuration in the `config.yml` so-called. One or more SMTP servers can be defined using the so-called "DSN" syntax:

```
smtp://<USERNAME>:<PASSWORD>@<HOSTNAME>:<PORT>
```

Replace the `<PLACEHOLDER>` with the information of the SMTP server used, or remove them accordingly. See also the 
information in the official [Symfony documentation][SymfonyMailer].

{{% notice warning %}}
If your username or password contains special characters, they need to be "url encoded". There are several online
services you can use to quickly url encode any string, e.g. [urlencoder.org](https://www.urlencoder.org/). Make sure to
encode the username and password separately (not together with the colon).
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice tip %}}
Instead of using `smtp://` you can also `smtps://` to automatically use SSL encryption over port `465`.
{{% /notice %}}

```yml
# config/config.yml
framework:
    mailer:
        transports:
            application: smtps://exampleuser:examplepassword@example.com
            website1: smtps://email@example.org:foobar@example.org
            website2: smtps://email@example.de:foobar@example.de
```

In the second step, the configured transports can be made available in the back end via the Contao framework 
configuration. In the following example, the transports `website1` and `website2` are made available:

```yml
# config/config.yml
contao:
    mailer:
        transports:
            website1: ~
            website2: ~
```

If the symfony application cache has been refreshed afterwards, these email configurations will be available for 
selection in the Contao back end.

If no transport is configured, the information from the `parameters.yml` is used. If a transport is configured but no transport 
is selected in the Contao back end, the first defined transport is used automatically.
{{% /notice %}}

Optionally, you can now overwrite the sender address for each transport:

```yml
# config/config.yml
contao:
    mailer:
        transports:
            website1:
                from: email@example.org
            website2:
                from: Lorem Ipsum <email@example.de>
```

It is also possible to define translations for the descriptions of the options in the back end:

```yml
# translations/mailer_transports.en.yml
website1: 'SMTP for Website 1'
website2: 'SMTP for Website 2'
```

```yml
# translations/mailer_transports.de.yml
website1: 'SMTP für Webseite 1'
website2: 'SMTP für Webseite 2'
```

**Clear cache** 
In order to enable these changes, the application cache must be rebuilt using the Contao Manager ("Maintenance" &gt; 
"Rebuild Production Cache") or alternatively via the command line. To do the latter you have to execute the following in 
the Contao installation directory:

```bash
php vendor/bin/contao-console cache:clear --env=prod --no-warmup
```
