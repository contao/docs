The Animated Timeline Bundle is a jQuery extension for contao 4 based on jQuery-Roadmap, which allows you to render 
content in a dynamic timeline with fadeIn animation.

You can choose between a horizontal and vertical timeline. You can also combine both so that the horizontal timeline 
is displayed on desktop devices and the vertical timeline is displayed on mobile devices.

Detailed instructions can be found at [docs.pdir.de](https://docs.pdir.de/#/animated-timeline/index).
