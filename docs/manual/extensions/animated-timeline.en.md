The Animated Timeline Bundle is a jQuery extension for contao 4 based on jQuery Roadmap, which allows you to render content in a dynamic timeline with fadeIn animation.

You can choose between a horizontal and vertical timeline. You can also combine both so that the horizontal timeline is displayed on desktop devices and the vertical timeline is displayed on mobile devices.

Detailed instructions can be found at [docs.pdir.de](https://docs.pdir.de/#/animated-timeline/index).
