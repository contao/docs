_from [MetaModels Team](https://now.metamodel.me/en/about/team)_

MetaModels (MM) is an extension with which it is possible to create a wide variety of structured data and to output
them on a website according to different criteria such as list and detail views, filterings, sortings, pagination,
multilingualism and others more. 

The possibilities which data content can be used range from product catalogues, events, food plans, adress and employee
lists, houses for sale or rent to picture galleries or multilingual text/image content - all that can be integrated
seamlessly into Contao.
