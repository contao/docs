is a version control service for software projects using [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) and is home to 
among other things, the [Contao documentation](https://github.com/contao/docs/).

familiar with it.


## Correct small errors

If you find a typo while reading the documentation or want to reword something, the easiest way to do so is to 
easiest way to do this is directly through GitHub.


### Edit the page and create a fork of the repository

Click on the "Edit this page" link in the upper right corner and you will be redirected to GitHub:

![Edit this page](/de/contributing/images/de/diese-seite-bearbeiten.png?classes=shadow)

On your first post, you will be asked to [fork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)) 
from the [repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_repository) "contao/docs", click on "Fork this repository".

![Fork this repository](/de/contributing/images/de/fork-this-repository.png?classes=shadow)


### Edit content

Edit the content, describe your changes and click the "Propose file change" button.

![Edit the content](/de/contributing/images/de/inhalt-bearbeiten.png?classes=shadow)


### Create branch and commit

GitHub will now create a new branch within your fork and a commit for your changes and will show a preview of your 
changes will be displayed:

![Create Branch and Commit](/de/contributing/images/de/branch-und-commit-erzeugen.png?classes=shadow)

If everything is correct, click the "Create pull request" button.


### Adding further changes before the pull request

If you want to edit more content before the pull request, for example by making adjustments to corresponding translations, switch to your fork instead and select the newly created branch. Here you can make your additional changes and comment them.

Then you can finally start the pull request via "Contribute/Open pull request".


### Create pull request

Since you do not have permissions to make changes directly to the official repository, you make a request to commit your changes to the official repository.

You can make final adjustments to your pull request if necessary. 
Click the "Create pull request" button again.

![Create pull request](/de/contributing/images/de/create-pull-request.png?classes=shadow)

**Congratulations!** You have just created a pull request for the official Contao documentation! The 
community will now review your pull request and (possibly) suggest changes.


### Fork update

If you want to propose further changes, check first if your fork is up to date. You can then sync your fork via GitHub using »Fetch upstream«.

![GitHub Fetch upstream](/de/contributing/images/de/github-fork-fetch-upstream.png?classes=shadow)


## Write a contribution for the documentation

If you are planning a large contribution or you prefer to work on your own computer, read on here 
and we will show you an alternative way to send pull requests to the Contao documentation.

### Install Git

To do this, you need to [install Git on your operating system](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).


### Create a fork of the repository

If you do not have an account on GitHub yet, [create](https://github.com/join) one and switch to the 
official Contao documentation repository at [github.com/contao/docs](https://github.com/contao/docs). Click on 
the button "[Fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)" to transfer the repository to your 
personal account. This is only necessary if you are contributing to the documentation for the first time. 

![Fork this repository](/de/contributing/images/de/fork-this-repository.png?classes=shadow)


### Clone the forked repository 

Clone the forked repository on your local machine:

Create a directory named `contao` and change to it with **c**hange **d**irectory.

```bash
cd contao
```

When cloning, you install the Hugo Learn theme as a submodule of git.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/docs.git
```

or

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/docs.git
```


### Install Hugo Site Generator

The documentation is created with the [Hugo-Site-Generator](https://gohugo.io/), so you have to install 
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) on your system first. If you have already installed Hugo 
at an earlier time, it is recommended that you 
[Update the software](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#upgrade-hugo).

### Create preview of the documentation

Creating a preview of the documentation is done with the `make` command. There are several commands available 
available, depending on which part of the documentation you want to build.

```bash
make build-dev
make build-manual
```

Creates all documentation in the `build` directory.

```bash
make live-dev
make live-manual
```

Creates a live preview that automatically tracks changes in the `docs` directory and reloads the frontend. 
reloads. The frontend is accessible via [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313).


```bash
make clean
```

Cleans up the `build` directory.


{{% notice tip %}}
Alternatively, you can create the local preview without the `make` command. On the console you change 
to the subdirectory `page` and create the local preview with the command: 
`hugo server --cleanDestinationDir --environment manual --destination ../build/manual`.

## Synchronize fork with original repository

If you haven't worked with your fork for a while, your fork may show the following message on GitHub. 
message `This branch is 7 commits behind contao:main.`.


So before you make any changes to the docs, you can make sure that your fork is synchronized with the original repository. 
repository.

Switch to the clone of the forked repository with `cd`.

```bash
cd docs
```

Add the original repository once as a new remote repository and specify it as the upstream repository.


```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/contao/docs.git
```

{{% notice info %}}
The [Remote name](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/renaming-a-remote) "upstream" can be freely selected or renamed. 
can also be renamed later.

Fetch the data of the upstream repository with `fetch`.


```bash
git fetch upstream

```

The commits that are different from your fork are now in separate branches in your local environment. 
in your local environment. With the next command, you merge them.


```bash
git merge upstream/main
```

Now execute the following command to update your fork.


```bash
git push
```

On GitHub, your fork now displays the message `This branch is even with contao:main.`.



### Create Branch

Before you edit the content, we make sure by creating your own branch (reference to a snapshot) 
that you can work on the documentation in parallel with others. Branches are independent development branches.

Create a new branch from the current one.


```bash
git checkout -b YOUR-BRANCH-NAME
```


### Edit content

Now that the basic requirements for documenting have been met, you can expand the docu with your 
contribution.

You can find the documentation files in the `docs` directory of your local Hugo installation.

- The Contao developer documentation is located in the `dev` directory.
- The Contao user manual is located in the `manual` directory.

When all customizations or additions have been made, we restore them to our fork.


### Transfer changes to your repository

Now the data is on your local machine and the next step is to commit it to your repository on GitHub. 
repository.

You can use the following command to stager all changes for the next commit.

```bash
git add .
```

Then you add the changes to the local repository.

```bash
git commit -m "Eine aussagekräftige Commit-Nachricht eingeben"
```

To send the changes to your remote repository, run the following command.

```bash
git push origin YOUR-BRANCH-NAME
```

{{% notice info %}}
After "pushing" your own new branch, you will see a link to create the pull request on the console.

In the message, click on "Pull request.
