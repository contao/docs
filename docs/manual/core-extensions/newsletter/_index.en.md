This allows newsletter and various email recipient lists to be managed in the back end. Sending email newsletters 
directly from the back end is also possible, and the newsletters can be formatted very easily thanks to the Contao 
templating system. Front end modules for subscribing and unsubscribing are also included and double opt-in is 
supported by default.
