**[contao/newsletter-bundle](https://packagist.org/packages/contao/newsletter-bundle)**

This allows newsletter and various recipient lists to be managed in the backend. Sending newsletters is also done directly from the back end and the newsletters can be formatted very easily thanks to the Contao templating system. Frontend modules for subscribing and unsubscribing are also included and double opt-in is supported by default.
