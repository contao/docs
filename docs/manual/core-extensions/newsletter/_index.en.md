This allows newsletter and various recipient lists to be managed in the backend. Sending newsletters directly from the back end is also possible and the newsletters can be formatted very easily thanks to the Contao templating system. Frontend modules for subscribing and unsubscribing are also included and double opt-in is supported by default.
