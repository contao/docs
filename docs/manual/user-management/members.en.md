The administration of front end users is much simpler than the administration of back end users, because you do not have to work with mounts and single input fields. Member management is mainly about accessing protected subpages and changing personal data.

The term "members" dates back to the early days of Contao, when the software was mainly used for community pages. In the meantime, many commercial websites are also implemented with it, so you could also say "customers".

## Member groups

Members are also organized in groups and inherit access rights to protected pages from them.

### Auto-redirect

In the front end module "Login" you can define to which page members will be redirected after registration. In the group settings you can overwrite this default page with an individual destination page per group.

**Redirect on login:** Here you activate the individual redirect.

**Redirect page:** Here you select the target page.

### Group settings

Member groups can also be deactivated manually or automatically.

**Deactivate:** Here you can deactivate the group.

**Activate on:** Here you activate the group on a specific day at 0:00.

**Deactivate on:** Here you deactivate the group on a specific day at 0:00.

## Members

Unlike users, members are not so much concerned with access rights as with personal data such as name, address or telephone number.
