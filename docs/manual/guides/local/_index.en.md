You can also install Contao locally. This requires a web server, a database and PHP. For the different operating systems
ready-made solutions, such as [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org) or [Laragon](https://laragon.org/), exists. 

Another alternative is using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). If the current Docker releases are not available for your operating system, you can also use the [Docker Toolbox](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/).

The following descriptions only reflect possible alternatives of a local installation and therefore should only be treated as such.

When you are done with your local development, you can then transfer the installation to a live server.
