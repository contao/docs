The [Devilbox Project](http://devilbox.org/) is a complete LAMP stack for [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
If you use the Docker-Toolbox, 
[this part](https://devilbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/howto/docker-toolbox/docker-toolbox-and-the-devilbox.html#howto-docker-toolbox-and-the-devilbox) 
of the documentation are worth reading.

{{% notice note %}}
In order to run the Devilbox you need to have _Docker_ and _Docker Compose_ installed on your system. Read through the
[Devilbox Prerequisites documentation](https://devilbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/prerequisites.html) for
more information on that, if you are not running these applications yet on your system.

## Install and configure the Devilbox

There is no installation routine. You just have to download the files from the Devilbox 
[GitHub Page](https://github.com/cytopia/devilbox) into an empty directory. The configuration takes place via a single 
file. In your directory you will find the file `env-example`. Copy and rename the file to `.env`. In the new file you 
can now make your configurations. The following settings need to be changed:

* [NEW_UID](https://devilbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration-files/env-file.html#new-uid)
* [NEW_GID](https://devilbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration-files/env-file.html#new-gid)
* [HTTPD_DOCROOT_DIR](https://devilbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration-files/env-file.html#httpd-docroot-dir)
* [HTTPD_SERVER](https://devilbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration-files/env-file.html#httpd-server)
* [PHP_SERVER](https://devilbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration-files/env-file.html#php-server)
* [MYSQL_SERVER](https://devilbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration-files/env-file.html#mysql-server)

The individual steps (especially for the entries `NEW_UID` and` NEW_GID`) are well described in the 
[Devilbox Documentation](https://devilbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/install-the-devilbox.html#set-uid-and-gid). 
For Contao itself, the other entries should be set to something like this:

- `HTTPD_DOCROOT_DIR=DOCUMENT-ROOT` (DOCUMENT-ROOT = `public` (until and with Contao 4.11 `web`), also see 
[hosting-configuration](   https://docs.contao.org/manual/en/installation/system-requirements/#hosting-configuration)   
- `HTTPD_SERVER=apache-2.4`
- `PHP_SERVER=8.2`
- `MYSQL_SERVER=mariadb-10.3`

{{% notice note %}}
After every change in the configuration `.env` file, the Devilbox must be restarted.
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice warning %}}
**Do not delete entries in the .env file!** For example, by default, the entry `HTTPD_SERVER=nginx-stable` is set and 
`# HTTPD_SERVER=apache-2.4` is disabled (see **` # `** at the beginning of the line). To change such entries you only 
have to enable or disable them by adding or removing the comment symbol. Make sure to enable `HTTPD_SERVER=apache-2.4`. 
As a web server nginx could also be used. For Contao, however, further configuration of the web server will then be 
necessary.

## Start the Devilbox

Change to the directory and start the Devilbox with Docker:

```bash
docker-compose up httpd php mysql
```

Initially it can take a while to create and load each Docker image and the containers. In addition, it is recommended to 
run the first start in the foreground so that any errors become more visible.

Later starts are much faster afterwards and can be run in the background (option `-d`):

```bash
docker-compose up -d httpd php mysql
```


## Stop the Devilbox

The Devilbox should be shut down by stopping all containers and then deleting all containers.

```bash
docker-compose stop
docker-compose rm -f
```


## The Devilbox Dashboard

Once the Devilbox has started you can access the Devilbox dashboard in your browser under **`http: //127.0.0.1`**. The 
navigation gives you access to the various functions.

{{% notice note %}}
The IP address to use depends on your Docker environment. If you have the Docker-Toolbox installed, your IP address
may be different. The IP address can be determined by using the command `docker-machine ip`.

| **Tools**         | Access to tools such as `phpMyAdmin` |


## Prepare the Contao installation

One or more Contao installations are created in the Devilbox directory **`data/www`**. Each Contao installation will
reside in its own directory there. The directory name you choose will correspond to the vhost name. For example, a
directory named `contao4` will correspond to a vhost for `contao4.loc`.

You have created a directory (e. g. `contao4`). Change to this directory and create a new subfolder `public`(until and 
with Contao 4.11 `web`). Copy the Contao Manager `.phar` file into this folder and rename the file to 
`contao-manager.phar.php`.

{{% notice note %}}
The domain suffix `.loc` is the default. However, this can be changed in the `.env` file via the entry `TLD_SUFFIX`.
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice note %}}
The manual editing of »`/etc/hosts`« may be neglected. The »Devilbox« offers a
"[Auto DNS](https://devilbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intermediate/setup-auto-dns.html) feature.
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice note %}}
Since devilbox 3 you may also use a TLD-Suffix `dvl.to`. Then all \*.dvl.to will be redirected to 127.0.0.1 
automatically.
{{% /notice %}}


## Installation via the Contao Manager

Start `phpMyAdmin` in the Devilbox dashboard via `Tools/phpMyAdmin` and create a new database. Change then in the 
navigation to the page `Virtual Hosts`. Here you should see a list of your existing web projects and you can call them 
right away. You can now initiate the Contao installation via the Contao Manager. For example: 
`contao4.loc/contao-manager.phar.php`.

The further procedure is then identical to the normal installation.


## Installation via the command line

By default, the PHP memory limit for the Devilbox's PHP container is too low and therefore must be previously configured 
for Composer. Change to the directory `cfg`. Did you configure the devilbox with PHP 8.2 in the `.env` file, make the 
following changes accordingly in the directory `cfg/php-ini-8.2`. Create a file `memory_limit.ini` with the following 
entry:

```bash
[PHP]
memory_limit = -1
```

Afterwards you have to restart the Devilbox. The Devilbox main directory contains the files `shell.sh` and` shell.bat`.
So you can plug into the running Devilbox PHP container. Here are already 
[numerous tools](https://devilbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readings/available-tools.html) preinstalled. Also `composer`. 
After calling you are in the directory `shared/http`. To install e.g. Contao 4.13 in a directory `contao4` you just 
have to enter:

```bash
composer create-project contao/managed-edition contao4 4.13
```

Create a new database:

```bash
mysql -u root -h mysql -p -e 'CREATE DATABASE db_contao4;'
```

{{% notice tip %}}
Keep the Devilbox shell open in a separate terminal window while you work. You can then easily run Contao commands in 
this window which eventually will provide more information as if being run under the host. Such as:
```bash
vendor/bin/contao-console cache:warmup --env=dev -v
```
{{% /notice %}}


## The Contao Install Tool

The settings for the Contao Install Tool are basically identical. You only have to pay attention to the following entries:

| Entry        | Value                |
| :----------- | :------------------- |
| **Host**     | mysql                |
| **Username** | root                 |
| **Password** | Do not enter a value |

{{% notice note %}}
The user `root` with empty password is the Devilbox default setting. This could be changed in the Devilbox 
[configuration](https://devilbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/support/faq.html#can-i-change-the-mysql-root-password). In 
this case, you must enter your configured credentials in the Contao Install Tool.
{{% /notice %}}


## Useful Information: Running multiple PHP versions in parallel (from devilbox 3 on)

The default settings are set in the devilbox directory.   
In the `compose` directory you will find the file `docker-compose.override.yml-php-multi.yml`. Copy the file to the 
devilbox directory and change the filename to `docker-compose.override.yml`".

Do you have a project <project> that should run with a different PHP version (7.4 in our example) than the one set in 
the .env file (in our example 8.2)?   
Create a directory `.devilbox` in this project directory and a file `backend.cfg` in it with the following content:

```bash
conf:phpfpm:tcp:php74:9000
```

Start devilbox like so:

```bash
docker-compose up php httpd bind php74
```

{{% notice note %}}
Example:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Projekt</th>
    <th>.env PHP-version</th>
    <th>backend.cfg existing?</th>
    <th>bind Option</th>
    <th>Projekt runs under</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>contao5</td>
    <td>8.2</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>-</td>
    <td>8.2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>contao4</td>
    <td>8.2</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>php74</td>
    <td>7.4</td>
  </tr>
</table>
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice tip %}}
You can create a backend.cfg preemptively in each project directory and comment out the contents if the project does not 
need to be treated separately.
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice tip %}}
In the Devilbox Dashboard, under `Virtual Hosts` in the `back end` column, you can see which PHP version is actually 
being used for a project. (Currently, there is a small bug: commented out configurations are not recognized as passive.)

## Useful information: PHP Xdebug

In the 
[Devilbox-Manual](https://devilbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intermediate/configure-php-xdebug.html?highlight=xdebug#configure-php-xdebug-1) 
you will find an outdated documentation that still shows the basic procedure well. In my IDE, the following 
configuration works very well:

{{< tabs groupId="Xdebug">}}

{{% tab name="launch.json" %}}
```
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Listen for Xdebug",
      "type": "php",
      "request": "launch",
      "port": 9003,
      "pathMappings": {
        "/shared/httpd/": "${workspaceFolder}/projects/"
      },
      "log": true,
      "stopOnEntry": true
    },
    .
    .
    .

  ]
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab name="xdebug.ini" %}}
Create a xdebug.ini in the directory `devilbox/cfg/php-ini-8.2` (example for PHP 8.2) with this content
```
; PHP.ini configuration
;
[PHP]
; Defaults
xdebug.mode                 = debug
xdebug.remote_handler       = dbgp
xdebug.start_with_request   = yes

; How to connect
xdebug.client_port          = 9003
xdebug.client_host          = host.docker.internal
xdebug.discover_client_host = false

; Logging
xdebug.log                  = /shared/httpd/xdebug.log
xdebug.log_level            = 7

; IDE Configuration
xdebug.idekey               = VSCODE
```
