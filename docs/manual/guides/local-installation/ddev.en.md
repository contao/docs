DDEV is an open source tool for launching local PHP development environments in minutes.

DDEV creates a `config.yaml`, this contains all settings for your project. This can be versioned in GIT and supports collaborative work in teams or freelancers.

{{% notice note %}}
To use the DDEV, _Docker_ must be installed on your system. If this is not yet
the case, you can download the
[DDEV documentation](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/install/docker-installation/) for
more information about installing these programs.

## Install DDEV

DDEV is available for all platforms, please refer to the [DDEV documentation](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/install/ddev-installation/) for the installation of your platform.

## Create project

{{% notice tip %}}
The [Contao demo website](https://demo.contao.org/) is maintained for the currently supported Contao versions and can be [optionally 
installed](https://github.com/contao/contao-demo). Via the Contao Manager you can simply select this option during the first installation.

Open the console of your choice, create the desired directory and then change to it. The directory name reflects the subsequent project hostname. However, you can [configure this](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/extend/additional-hostnames/) additionally.

```shell
mkdir contao && cd contao
```

Create the DDEV configuration with:

```shell
ddev config --project-type=php --docroot=public --webserver-type=apache-fpm --php-version=8.2
```

Install Contao 5.3:

```shell
ddev composer create contao/managed-edition:5.3
```

After installation, the database credentials must be entered in the `.env.local`. At the same time, we also set up 
[Mailpit](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/usage/developer-tools/#email-capture-and-review-mailpit) directly.

```shell
ddev dotenv set .env.local --database-url=mysql://db:db@db:3306/db --mailer-dsn=smtp://localhost:1025
```

Then create the database:

```shell
ddev exec contao-console contao:migrate --no-interaction
```

Create backend user (Administrator):

```shell
ddev exec contao-console contao:user:create --username=admin --name=Administrator --email=admin@example.com --language=en --admin
```

Call up the Administration in the browser:

```shell
ddev launch contao
```

Open the console of your choice, create the desired directory and then change to it. The directory name reflects the subsequent project hostname. However, you can [configure this](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/extend/additional-hostnames/) additionally.

```shell

Create the DDEV configuration with:

```shell
ddev config --project-type=php --docroot=public --webserver-type=apache-fpm --php-version=8.2
```

After installation, the database access data must be entered in the .env.local. At the same time, we also set up 
[Mailpit](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/usage/developer-tools/#email-capture-and-review-mailpit) directly.

```shell

```

Download the Contao Manager, rename it (.php) and copy it into the `public` directory. You can also use `wget` or `curl` to do this.

```shell
ddev start
ddev exec "wget -O public/contao-manager.phar.php https://download.contao.org/contao-manager/stable/contao-manager.phar"
```

Open the Contao Manager and follow the instructions:

```shell
ddev launch contao-manager.phar.php
```

## Additional information

- `ddev start` starts the project, `ddev stop` ends it. Make sure beforehand that you have changed to the project folder.

- `ddev poweroff` can stop all started projects/containers from any directory.

- With `ddev ssh` you can switch to the shell of the container and work on the console. The `ddev` binary is not available in the container, so first switch to the host console with `exit`.

- `ddev describe` gives an overview of the services available in the project and how to access them.

- `ddev xdebug on` starts XDebug. [Information about the IDE setup](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/debugging-profiling/step-debugging/#ide-setup)

{{% notice note %}}
If you are a Windows user using the "Git Bash" as a console, it may be necessary, depending on your "Git for Windows" configuration, to prepend the command `winpty` (e.g.: `winpty ddev ssh`).

## Custom PHP Configuration

DDEV can be used to provide additional PHP configurations for a project. You can add any number of `.ini` files in the directory `.ddev/php/`. Subsequent changes require a `ddev restart`. Further information can be found in the [DDEV documentation](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/extend/customization-extendibility/#custom-php-configuration-phpini).

An example file in `.ddev/php/my-php.ini` could look like this:

```ini
[PHP]
memory_limit = -1
```


## DDEV Addons

DDEV now offers [Services as Addon](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/extend/additional-services/).


### Example: Adminer

```shell
ddev get ddev/ddev-adminer && ddev restart
```

With `ddev describe` you can find out how to reach Adminer.
