The [Contao demo](https://demo.contao.org/contao) represents a complete website for the purpose of demonstrating the Contao possibilities. 
You can view the demo on [contao.org](https://contao.org/) and test it including backend access or you can install the Contao demo and 
extend it according to your needs.

The following information is not a complete tutorial regarding a [local Contao installation](/en/guides/local-installation/), CSS 
or [SASS/SCSS](/en/guides/sass-less-integration/) usage. Only some of the options that you could use for customization are listed here. 
These should serve as suggestions and are independent of the numerous other options in Contao.


## Installation

You can easily install the Contao demo via the Contao Manager during a new installation. It is also possible to install 
via the console. Information on this can be found on the corresponding [GitHub page](https://github.com/contao/contao-demo). You can then 
follow the complete implementation of the Contao demo website in the Contao backend.


## Layout Adjustments

The Contao demo uses `.scss` files for the design. The `app.scss` is used directly in the respective Contao theme 
settings and then compiled and provided as a final `.css` file via Contao.

What you should consider here, is described in more detail in this article "[Sass/Less Integration](/en/guides/sass-less-integration/)".

### Sample

With the knowledge of the above Contao options (via "[scssphp/scssphp](https://github.com/scssphp/scssphp)") you can edit the `.scss` files 
directly in the Contao backend. For example, if you want to adjust the color values of the demo, you can make and save 
changes via the Contao [file manager](/en/file-manager/) in the file "`contaodemo/theme/src/scss/variables/_colors.scss`". Further 
SASS variables can be found in the files "`_sizes.scss`", "`_fonts.scss`" and "`_animation.scss`".

However, in order for the changes to these ([SASS partial](https://sass-lang.com/guide/#partials)) files to be applied, you must then touch 
and save "`app.scss`" once (see also: "[Sass/Less Integration](/en/guides/sass-less-integration/)").


## Dart Sass

The "[scssphp/scssphp](https://github.com/scssphp/scssphp)" library used by Contao may not support current 
"[Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass/)" features such as "[@use](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use/)", 
"[@forward](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/forward/)" or other "Dart Sass" [modules](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/).

{{% notice note %}}
This may also apply to existing SASS extensions, e.g. for the "[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)" editor etc.
{{% /notice %}}

In this case, in conjunction with a [local Contao installation](/en/guides/local-installation/) and a pure "Dart Sass" installation (see below), 
it is therefore more optimal to compile the `.scss` files locally according to the requirements and then only reference 
the final `.css` file (i.e. `app.css`) in Contao.


### Preparations

You can find the procedure for installing "Dart Sass" [here](https://sass-lang.com/install/). There are numerous instructions and tutorials 
available, so we will not go into them in detail here.

In conjunction with "[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)", it is a good idea to create the "`package.json`" outside the Contao directories. 
This way, you could also serve other Contao installations later on and only have to adjust the respective paths of the 
SCSS and CSS directories relative to "`package.json`". There is also the helpful option of defining the 
"[SASS instructions](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/)" once via "[nodescripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/using-npm/scripts)" 
and starting them conveniently.

If you use the generated "`app.css`" of the demo in the Contao theme settings, the references to the respective `.scss` 
sections are missing in the browser dev tools. Therefore, "[source maps](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#source-maps)" are required, which you can create 
automatically via SASS and use during local development. If the respective "source map" (`.map`) is available next to 
the "`app.css`", the browser dev tools then point directly to the corresponding entries in the `.scss` files.

{{% notice tip %}}
This is helpful for the next step. With the SASS flag "[--watch](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#watch)", the creation 
of a `.css` file is automatically triggered as soon as you save changes to the `.scss` files (including SASS partials), 
even via the browser dev tools (with workspace shares). Once activated, you can now directly track, change and save the 
effects of your `.scss` customizations in the browser dev tools.

## Local layout adjustments

For the example of the color adjustments, we only want to highlight the SASS variables to be changed for the sake of 
clarity. To do this, we create a new SASS partial file "`_custom.scss`" in the "`scss`" directory. In this file, we only 
copy the variables from "`variables/_colors.scss`" that we actually want to change or overwrite.

We change the color values in "`_custom.scss`" and include them as the first entry in "`app.scss`" using 
"[@import](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/import/)". The new color specifications are now included but not yet taken into account!

In the "`variables/_colors.scss`" we still have to use the SASS flag "[!default](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables/#default-values)". 
This means that the existing values of the SASS variables are only used if there is not already a definition. However, 
this is given by our specifications from "`_custom.scss`" and therefore these color specifications are now taken into 
account.

The three files could now look like this in excerpts:

{{< tabs groupId="SASS-SAMPLE">}}

{{% tab name="_colors.scss" %}}
```scss
// global colors
$c-primary--50: hsla(30, 100%, 97%, 1)  !default;
$c-primary--500: hsla(30, 100%, 48%, 1) !default;
$c-primary--600: hsla(30, 100%, 42%, 1) !default;
$c-primary--700: hsla(30, 100%, 30%, 1) !default;

$c-secondary--700: hsla(207, 44%, 26%, 1) !default;
$c-secondary--800: hsla(207, 44%, 21%, 1) !default;
$c-secondary--900: hsla(207, 44%, 14%, 1) !default;

// background gradients
$gradient--1: radial-gradient(50% 50% at 50% 50%, hsla(207, 44%, 26%, 1) 0%, hsla(207, 44%, 21%, 1) 100%) !default;

...
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab name="_custom.scss" %}}
```scss
// ### custom color variables

$c-primary--50: hsla(30, 100%, 97%, 1);
$c-primary--500: hsla(212, 100%, 48%, 1);
$c-primary--600: hsla(212, 100%, 42%, 1);
$c-primary--700: hsla(212, 100%, 30%, 1);

$c-secondary--700: hsla(242, 100%, 25%, 1);
$c-secondary--800: hsla(242, 100%, 21%, 1);
$c-secondary--900: hsla(242, 100%, 14%, 1);

$gradient--1: radial-gradient(50% 50% at 50% 50%, $c-primary--700 0%, $c-secondary--900 100%);
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab name="app.scss" %}}
```scss
// ### custom variables
@import 'custom';

// ### general variables
...
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{< /tabs >}}


## Conclusion

You could easily use the above implementation directly in Contao. As mentioned, however, "Dart Sass" offers numerous 
other possibilities. Instead of explicitly defining the color specifications in "`_custom.scss`" via "CSS hsla()", you 
could also use [SASS modules](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules/color/) for color conversion.

Furthermore, the use of "[@use](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use/)" and "[@forward](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/forward/)" instead of "[@import](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/import/)" would be useful, especially for 
larger projects. Among other things, "namespaces" were introduced here, which enable clear and secure referencing.

If you would like to use these and future "Dart Sass" features, you can do so via a local workflow.

{{% notice tip %}}
Of course, you are not restricted, regardless of Contao versions. For example, you could also use established CSS 
variables ("[custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties)") or other combinations in your workflow.
