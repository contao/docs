Over the years, several websites and articles about Contao have been created, partly in consultation with the Contao team, partly completely self-sufficient. Some pages contain the translation of the documentation, others are contact points of local communities or offer tutorials on special topics. You can find an overview of all resources known to us on the [Contao network page](https://contao.org/de/netzwerk.html).

## The project website

The official project website [contao.org](https://contao.org/de/) is the central contact point for Contao on the web.

At the beginning there is the point `Entdecken`. The search for the right CMS can be quite tedious at times, so it can be assumed that a visitor has already seen several CMS websites before he or she has landed on Contao. For this reason, all important information is collected in one place, from the feature overview to news, online demo, events, case studies and the Contao team.

Once the user is convinced of the system, he will usually want to download and install it himself, so the next category is`Download`. Besides the program downloads, you can find the Contao logo in the Media section, the fan page logo for download and the release plan of Contao.

In the next section you will `Partner`find the list of Contao partners that can help you with your Contao project.

In the section `Support`, you can get an overview of Contao, find answers to the most frequently asked questions, report bugs or view the Contao network.

Finally, the category `Association`. The association was founded in Switzerland in 2012 and aims to promote the Contao Open Source CMS. This promotion includes the following professional goals:

- Organizing events to inform and train members and other interested parties
- internal and external communication to disseminate knowledge and skills for using the system, in particular via the project's websites
- Funding for new and further development of extensions
- Funding for the further development of the Contao Open Source CMS software project
- Public relations and dissemination funding

So if you care about Contao, you can become part of something big by joining[ the Contao Association](https://association.contao.org/mitglied-werden.html).

Once you have installed and understood the system, you can roughly estimate what functions it offers and which ones you might need to implement your own website. In this case a look or a search in the extension list can't hurt.

## The Development Environment

Of all the many tasks and activities involved in an Open Source project, the further development of the software is of course the most important. After all, the entire network has built up around the product. And because development is so important, it is driven transparently on the platformGitHub[ in the monorepository contao/contao](https://github.com/contao/contao/). In addition, monthly public[ conference calls](https://contao.org/de/mumble-calls.html) are held, where core developers can exchange information via tickets marked "up for discussion".

In this section `Code`you will find an overview of the commits, branches, releases and contributors.

If you'd like to report a bug, this is the place to do `Issues`so. Before you report a bug, please check the following list:

- the bug has already been reported by someone (reviewing the issues)
- are you on the latest stable version of Contao
- how to reproduce the error in a fresh Contao installation (step-by-step instructions)
- how to reproduce the error in the [online demo of Contao](https://demo.contao.org/contao/login) (step-by-step instructions)

## Contao on the social web

Of course, Contao is also represented in the so-called "social web", which is currently dominated by Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram and Pinterest. You can find the official Contao fan page on Facebook at www.facebook.com/contao. It is updated regularly and contains the official announcements as well as small status updates on current topics. If you are not a fan yet, you should definitely become one now.

On Twitter you can find Contao at [twitter.com/contaocms](https://twitter.com/contaocms), on YouTube atwww.youtube.com/user/contaocms, on Instagram atwww.instagram.com/contaocms and on Pinterest atwww.pinterest.de/contaocms.

## The German speaking community

The German speaking community is currently the largest of all Contao communities and has its own platform, which can be found at [community.contao.org](https://community.contao.org/de/). There you can get in contact with other Contao enthusiasts and discuss all topics around the CMS, the Internet and the life as a webworker.

If you would like to meet the people you meet in this virtual world in the real world, you can do so at the conference, at the camp or at the various regulars' tables. A list of events can be found on the [project website](https://contao.org/de/veranstaltungen.html).
