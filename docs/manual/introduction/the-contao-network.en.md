Over the years, several websites and articles about Contao have been created, partly in consultation with the Contao 
team, partly completely self-sufficient. Some pages contain the translation of the documentation, others are contact 
points of local communities or offer tutorials on special topics. You can find an overview of all resources known to us 
on the [Contao network page](https://contao.org/en/network.html).


## The project website

The official project website [contao.org](https://contao.org/en/) is the central contact point for Contao on the web.

At the beginning there is the point `Discover`. The search for the right CMS can be quite tedious at times, so it can 
be assumed that a visitor has already seen several CMS websites before he or she has landed on Contao. For this reason, 
all important information is collected in one place, from the feature overview to news, online demo, events, case 
studies and the Contao team.

After the user is convinced of the system, he will usually want to download and install it himself. Consequently, 
`Download` is the next category. In addition to the program downloads, you can find the Contao and the fanpage logo for 
download as well as the Contao release plan in the Media section.

In the next section you will find the `Partners` list of Contao partners that can help you with your Contao project.

In the section `Support`, you can get an overview of Contao, find answers to the most frequently asked questions, 
report bugs or view the Contao network.

Once you have installed and understood the system, you can roughly estimate what functions it offers and which ones you 
might need to implement your own website. In this case a look or a search in the 
[extension list](https://extensions.contao.org/) can't hurt.


## The Development Environment

Of all the many tasks and activities involved in an Open Source project, the further development of the software is of 
course the most important. After all, the entire network has built up around the product. And because development is so 
important, it is driven transparently on the platform [GitHub in the monorepository contao/contao](https://github.com/contao/contao/). 
In addition, monthly [public conference calls](https://contao.org/en/mumble-calls.html) are held, where core developers 
can exchange information via tickets marked "up for discussion".

In the `Code` section you will find an overview of the commits, the branches, the releases and the contributors.

If you want to report a bug, the `Issues` section is for that. Before you report a bug, please go through the following 
list:

- the bug has already been reported by someone (reviewing the issues)
- are you on the latest stable version of Contao
- how to reproduce the error in a fresh Contao installation (step-by-step instructions)
- how to reproduce the error in the [online demo of Contao](https://demo.contao.org/contao/login) (step-by-step 
  instructions)


## Contao on the social web

Of course, Contao is also represented in the so-called "social web", which is currently dominated by Facebook, Twitter, 
YouTube, Instagram and Pinterest. You can find the official Contao fan page on Facebook at 
[www.facebook.com/contao](https://www.facebook.com/contao). It is updated regularly and contains the official 
announcements as well as small status updates on current topics. If you are not a fan yet, you should definitely become 
one now.

On Twitter you can find Contao at [twitter.com/contaocms](https://twitter.com/contaocms), on YouTube at 
[www.youtube.com/user/contaocms](https://www.youtube.com/user/contaocms), on Instagram at 
[www.instagram.com/contaocms](https://www.instagram.com/contaocms/) and on Pinterest at 
[www.pinterest.de/contaocms](https://www.pinterest.de/contaocms/).


## The German speaking community

The German speaking community is currently the largest of all Contao communities and has its own platform, which can be 
found at [community.contao.org/de/](https://community.contao.org/de/). There you can get in contact with other Contao 
enthusiasts and discuss all topics around the CMS, the Internet and the life as a webworker. The english speaking 
community can be found at [community.contao.org/en/](https://community.contao.org/en/).

If you would like to meet the people you meet in this virtual world in the real world, you can do so at the conference, 
at the camp or at the various regulars' tables. A list of events can be found on the 
[project website](https://contao.org/en/events.html).
