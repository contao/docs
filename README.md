# Contao Documentation

The documentation for the Contao project will be maintained in this repository.

The details below are only necessary if you want to install the docs locally.
If you just want to contribute content, read the [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).


## Cloning

The project installs the Hugo Learn theme as a git submodule. Thus when cloning
the repository, you need to use the `--recurse-submodules` parameter:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:contao/docs.git
```
or:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/contao/docs.git
```


## Updating the Theme

To update the theme after cloning, simply run the following command:

```bash
git submodule foreach git pull origin master
```


## Build

The documentation is built using the [Hugo site generator](https://gohugo.io/), 
thus you need to [install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) 
first on your system.

_Note:_ version 0.55.x of Hugo is incompatible with some of the theme's features. 
Building is still possible, however the rendering of those shortcodes will be wrong.

Building is done using the `make` command. There are different commands available 
depending on what part of the documentation you want to build.

```
make build-dev
make build-manual
```

Builds the entire documentation into the `build` directory.

```
make live-dev
make live-manual
```

Spins up the development server which automatically tracks changes in the `docs` 
directory and rebuilds the front end. You can access the front end on [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313).

```
make clean
```

Cleans the build directory.


### Note

Your are not dependent on the [Makefile](Makefile). If `make` is not available 
in your operating system, you can still invoke the hugo commands. For example:

```
cd page
hugo server --cleanDestinationDir --environment manual --destination ../build/manual 
```
