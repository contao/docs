# Contributing


## Documented versions

Only major versions are documented (e.g. Contao 4 and later on Contao 5).


## General rules

* Only use ATX style headlines (e.g. `# H1` or `### H3`).
* See [learn.netlify.com/en/cont/markdown/](https://learn.netlify.com/en/cont/markdown/) 
  and [learn.netlify.com/en/shortcodes/notice/](https://learn.netlify.com/en/shortcodes/) 
  for available markdown and shortcode syntax.
* Always add two empty lines above each headline.
* Add line breaks after 80 characters in paragraphs.
* Code examples should follow the Symfony Best Practices Book, use PHP 7.1 and
  put Contao related files to `contao`.
* When using examples for PHP code or YAML configurations etc., include the example
  path to the file as a comment as the very first line. Do not use the `<?php` open
  tag and also do not use the `declare()` statement.

Example for link references:
```
Lorem ipsum dolor [sit amet](https://contao.org/) consectetuer adipiscing elitr. Aenean massa. 
Cum sociis [natoque](https://www.google.com/) penatibus et magnis dis.
```


## New features

Since we will not maintain different versions of the documentation for each minor 
Contao version, some features will be documented which are only available in newer 
Contao version. In such a case, document the _old_ way first (if applicable), then 
show the new way with a notice of the minimum Contao version required.

You can use the following short code to automatically add a note for features of a 
specific Contao version:

```
{{< version "4.7" >}}
```


### Example:

```markdown
## DCA callbacks

### PHP array configuration 

â€¦

### Service tag

{{< version "4.8" >}}
```


## Structure


### Manual

TBD


### Development documentation

The development documentation is split into three parts:

* Documentation
* Reference
* Cookbook


#### Documentation

This part of the development documentation should explain features of the Contao framework and how to use them. e.g. Templates, Palette Manipulator, image generation, etc. with references to the cookbook.


#### Reference

This part of the development documentation should be a full reference of all available hooks, callbacks, DCA configuration, available config settings, etc.


#### Cookbook

This should contain specific examples and use cases on how to use and implement the previously mentioned topics.


## Some notes about your markdown contribution

* The paths and filenames should be in English
* Consider that all markdown headings are taken over in the page navigation of the documentation
* Use images by copying existing or create new ones only


## The Hugo front matter variables

Every file needs at least the following [Hugo front matter](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/) variables on top of your markdown content:

* `title`: A title for the file (language specific). This entry reflects the main left navigation of the documentation also.
* `description`: The content description (language specific).
* `url`: The url path to build (language specific). This should only be used if you want the path to be different from the physical path e.g. for the German translation.
* `weight`: Used for the sorting order in the left main navigation of the documentation. The weight might not be necessary everywhere. It's only necessary, when files need to be sorted by something other than the default sorting (i.e. sorted by name).
* `menuTitle` (optional): The optional menuTitle entry reflects an alternative entry in the main left navigation of the documentation. This is especially helpful if the original title is too long for the navigation.


## Making changes

If you want to contribte changes to a page, simply use the "Edit this page" link 
at the top right of the documentation. Given that you have a GitHub account and 
are logged in, GitHub will automatically create a fork where you can create your 
changes in the respective markdown file. After comitting your changes, GitHub will 
offer you to create a Pull Request. 

When changes to your Pull Request are requested, you can directly edit the files 
within the Pull Request.
